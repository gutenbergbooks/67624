Unfinished Rainbows</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="first-word">The</span> rainbow was only a fragment of an arch
because the needed sunshine was withheld. Had
the sunlight been permitted to permeate all the
atmosphere with its golden glow, the arch would
have spanned the entire heavens.</p>

<p>This is the reason why, in hours of sorrow, we
do not grasp the fullness of God’s promise; we
permit the denser clouds of doubt and faithlessness
to keep the light of God from shining
through our griefs; or, with a little faith, we get
a gleam of light that gives us but a tiny fragment
of the bow.</p>

<p>While all the operations of this natural world
are tokens of God’s unfailing thoughtfulness in
keeping his covenant with man, a great event
has made the rainbow peculiarly the embodiment
of that thought. Looking from the narrow
window of the wave-tossed ark, upon the silent
grandeur of a world slowly arising from the
waters of an universal flood, Noah beheld the
rainbow and rejoiced in the blest assurance,
that, while the things of man are subject to the
ravages of time and destruction of contending<a href="#Page_6"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;6" id="Page_6"></span></a>
elements, the things of God are always stable
and secure. The most permanent products of
man’s hand and mind are soon swept away, but
the things of God endure, and continue faithful,
in working out their appointed courses. Through
storm or calm, events march with steady, unceasing
tread, knowing that God’s roads are never
worn, and God’s bridges never tremble and fall.
Above the placid, mysterious world, calmly
emerging from the muddy, wreck-strewn waters,
was the peaceful, radiant bow, smiling in confidence
upon him and his companions. The
world had changed, but the rainbow was just as
it had always been, stately, serene, and unaffrighted.
The crumbling, flood-torn earth had
not weakened its foundations, the drenching
rains had not faded its colors, the hurrying,
wind-swept clouds could not disturb it. Though
it were made out of hurrying light and drifting
mist it would not be swayed or moved even a
little. Under its archway walked the guarding
angels of God. Over the waters came the clear
voice once heard in Eden, uttering the promise,
“And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud
over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the
cloud: and I will remember my covenant.”</p>

<p>That is a sweeping promise that is literally
fulfilled in nature. All clouds carry rainbows.
Most of them are never seen by us because we<a href="#Page_7"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;7" id="Page_7"></span></a>
lack the necessary keenness of vision, or the
proper point of view to behold their woven
colors; many are only partially seen because
something intervenes and prevents a perfect
intersection of heavenly sunlight with our earth-born
mists; many are within the vision of all
observing men; but, whether we see it or not,
for every cloud there is a scarf of red and orange
and yellow and green and blue and scarlet and
purple. So, in spiritual matters, we find that for
every sorrow there are beautiful assurances of
God’s presence and unwavering covenant-keeping
power. If we do not see them it is not God’s
fault, for the light of his faithfulness transfixes
every cloud that arises above his earth-born
children.</p>

<p>There are the clouds of bereavement. The
Death Angel defied your love-locked doors and
bolted windows. Heeding neither your cry nor
your pleadings, he entered your home and
pushed aside the doctor and attending nurses
and friends, and touching the heart of your loved
one, stilled it to sleep. Your grief was such that
you did not see how you could live. The home
seemed empty and strangely silent. The entire
pathway seemed shrouded in the somber
shadows of your grief. Life was a desolation.
But you did not give up in despair. There was
a bow in the cloud. An arch of seven brilliant<a href="#Page_8"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;8" id="Page_8"></span></a>
hues reached from one horizon to another
horizon, and you knew that the One in whom
you had placed your trust had proven true. He
had not forgotten you. Looking at the rainbow,
the token of his covenant, you read in its
mingled colors the words of the Lord Jesus,
“I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in
me shall never die.” In your sorrow you found
that the bow of God’s promises never trembles.</p>

<p>You were facing financial disaster. All your
investments had proven bad. You had been
misled by false counsel. The savings of years
had been swept away by one fell swoop of disaster,
and with them had gone all the fond plans
for the future of your family and loved ones.
Your head reeled as you felt the earth giving
way beneath you; you were about to close your
eyes in despair, when suddenly, in the darkest
part of the overshadowing cloud, you saw the
rainbow. God had not forgotten you. Amid the
whirl and destruction of things his promises
never trembled. Its gleaming colors told you
that you were not alone, and spelled such a
message of hope and inspiration to your soul,
that you smiled in the face of adversity. Here
was the promise, “There is no want to them that
fear Him.” You had never seen the beauty of<a href="#Page_9"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;9" id="Page_9"></span></a>
those words before. You felt the thrill of a new
life and the confidence that you once placed in
riches, you now centered upon God.</p>

<p>There were the dark clouds of misplaced
friendship. You were confident that the one in
whom you were placing your trust was worthy,
but through that friendship you were betrayed,
and misrepresented, and made the object of
scorn and criticism. No cloud is darker than
that, no sorrow is harder to bear, and yet you
did not lose confidence in man. Above the
feathered edges of the cloud was the rainbow of
God’s promise, and you knew that if even father
and mother forsook you, the Lord would take
you up. The rainbow, as the symbol of God’s
promise, said: “Lo, I am with you always, even
unto the end of the world.”</p>

<p>But some one says, “I have never been able
to grasp the <em>fullness</em> of these promises. Amid
life’s clouds I cannot see the presence of the
Almighty.” That is not God’s fault, but because
one hinders the coming of the light. If you do
not permit the Spirit of God to shine upon your
sorrow with its golden light, the ministration of
the rainbow to your sorrow-smitten soul will
never be complete. The comforts of God are
known only by those who are willing to receive
his holy ministrations. The rainbow is never
finished for the one who refuses to receive Christ<a href="#Page_10"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;10" id="Page_10"></span></a>
fully and completely into his life. He is the
Light of the world, and his presence always
brings the promises of the Father to their fullest
possible earthly revelation and application. His
revelations are always complete and as comforting
as they are beautiful. His clear light of
goodness has always been making battle against
the darkness of sin’s mists and fogs. He is never
satisfied until his love has intercepted every
overshadowing cloud so that when you behold
the streaming banners of the bow, that always
follows and never precedes a storm, you may
know that you, through him, have already
gotten the victory. Light triumphs. The overshadowing
cloud is pierced. Instead of somberness
there is beauty.</p>

<p>The earthly rainbows will never be complete.
Here we behold at best only a segment of a
perfect circle. We have but a one-world view
and therefore can behold but half the rainbow.
In heaven we shall see the completed circle, as
John beheld it in his vision and exclaimed, with
rapturous delight, “There was a rainbow round
about the throne.” So glorious is the light of the
great, white throne, and the face, and the
raiment of Him that sat upon it, that to angelic
vision it is nestled in the center of a perfectly
rounded bow of brilliant hue.</p>

<p>The rainbow can never be destroyed, for the<a href="#Page_11"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;11" id="Page_11"></span></a>
light of Christ can never fade. Ever about the
throne of God, in perfect circle, shall gleam the
steady, colored token of God’s faithfulness
through all time and all eternity. The multitude
of white-robed ones that worship before the
throne are those who have come out “of great
tribulation,” they are those who have “overcome
through the blood of the Lamb,” therefore it is
fitting that the one choicest treasure saved from
the natural world in which they fought their
battles, and won their victories, should be the
rainbow, the richly colored symbol of God’s
faithfulness and mercy. What emotions thrill
our souls in this world when we look upon the
rainbow! What memories shall sweep through
our souls when we behold the rainbow that is
ever round about the great white throne of
God!</p>

Gathering Sunsets</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> sunset is the sheaf of the day’s activities,
wherein are bound all the roses and poppies and
fruits and grains of the passing hours, for the
experiences of life are constantly coming to full
harvest. Weary with toil and worn with watching,
we do not see the riches of to-day; or,
stirred by some new ambition, our eyes become
so fixed upon the future, that to-day’s golden
grain is trampled under foot and lost. Instead
of facing the morrow’s morn, rich with garnered
treasures, we greet it with empty hands. We are
not householders seeking strong-walled dwellings
and broad, extending acres, but are careless,
nomadic folk, wandering aimlessly from day to
day, as gypsies wander from town to town.
Having all things within our grasp, we possess
nothing. When touched by the hand of Death,
and taken out of life, the world is no more
disturbed than by the bursting of a bubble on
the ocean wave.</p>

<p>Sunsets are sheaves, and the brilliancy of their
coloring is God’s way of calling our attention
to their value. The waving of so many golden<a href="#Page_13"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;13" id="Page_13"></span></a>
and scarlet banners, by a myriad of unseen
hands, should awaken the most careless soul to
the consciousness that something mighty is
transpiring. Such banners and pageantry passing
through our streets would awaken the entire
city to wonderment and concern. For what king
are the banners waving? For what worthy cause
are all these ensigns thrown upon the wind?
What victory is celebrated here? Yet the sunsets
pass unheeded, and the golden sheaf of
another day is trampled under careless feet, and
left to mildew and decay.</p>

<p>The art of gathering sunsets, the grasping of
each day’s experiences with firm and constant
hold, is one to covet. Days are not something to
“pass through.” Each day is like unto an acre
of land, through which one may hurry, as in a
train, without thought of right or ownership; or
unto an acre of land which he holds in perpetual
ownership, adding that much to his estate, and
increasing his income through all the days that
follow. Rather, it is a sheaf of grain, supplying
food and affording strength for an ever-increasing
work which he may throw away, or keep for
future use. Sunset time is harvest time, and the
evening hour is the one in which to fill full the
granaries and treasure chests for days unborn.
Sunsets should be bound with the golden cords
of memory and kept forever.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_14"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;14" id="Page_14"></span></a></p>

<p>The pathway of life grows brightest for those
who have wasted fewest of their yesterdays.
Hours well spent and safely garnered never lose
the brightness of their sunshine. It always
glows in the sparkle of the eye, in the brightness
of a winning smile, in the warm atmosphere of
helpfulness with which they are surrounded.
Hours spent in sin and dissipation have no luster
to cast upon the afterdays, but goodness is
always luminous. Hours of right-living may be
likened to blazing suns that never cease to glow.
The ability to retain their brightness means an
ever-increasing splendor of life. It is this that
the inspired writer must have had in mind when
he wrote that the pathway of the just is as a
shining light, that shineth more and more unto
the perfect day.</p>

<p>The secret of perfection along any line of
endeavor is the gathering in and retaining the
good, at the same time sorting out and permanently
eliminating that which is bad. It is a
work of patience and progression. It requires
the fruitage of many days, the garnered glories
of many sunsets, to endow one with the riches of
genius; and not one single day should be lost.
The lapidist, whose magic touch changes pebbles
into glittering jewels to adorn the neck of
beauty; the sculptor, whose mallet-stroke is so
accurate that rough, ill-shapen stones become<a href="#Page_15"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;15" id="Page_15"></span></a>
forms of grace to inspire the generations; the
artist, whose brush quickens the common dust
and clay into marvelous paintings of unfading
color and undying sentiment; the botanist,
whose carefulness transforms barren waysides
into gardens, and the desert places into banqueting
halls; the metallurgist, whose powerful hand
takes the knotted lumps of ore and fashions
them into the bronze doors of a great cathedral—all
these represent that priceless frugality that
will not permit a sunset to escape. Their first
crude efforts were sheaves of rich experiences,
which they garnered and stored away in the
treasure chests of memory. They had the bright
light of their first sunsets to add to the morning
light of their second endeavors. They continued
to store the brightness of the passing experiences.
Day by day the light grew brighter,
until at last there came the perfect day, when
the whole world stood amazed at the perfection
of their handiwork. The loss of one sunset
would have faded the light and dimmed the
glory of their final achievement. All perfect art
is but gathered sunsets.</p>

<p>This law holds in the matter of spiritual perfection.
God does much for us at conversion,
when, through faith in him, we are changed by
his grace into new men and new women. It is
like a lost planet finding its central sun, and resuming<a href="#Page_16"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;16" id="Page_16"></span></a>
its accustomed place, and finding light,
and warmth, and life, and joy again. Wonderful
indeed is the power of God as manifested in the
conversion of any individual, but conversion is
not perfection. Perfection is something that the
inspired writer urges us “to go unto.” “And
beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith
virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
temperance; and to temperance patience;
and to patience godliness; and to godliness
brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
charity.”</p>

<p>Do not permit the colors of triumph to fade
from your first day’s sky. Hold on to that sunset.
Each day will furnish its added beam of
light. Faith, hope, and love, and all the Christian
graces will become more beautiful for you,
to you, and in you. The pathway will become
brighter and brighter. Life will have fewer
shadows because the light falls upon you from
so many angles and becomes more perfectly diffused.
To-morrow can have no hindering uncertainties,
for the light of the past experiences
illumines the future. There is light for every
darkened corner, and one may rejoice that all
things are working together for good, because we
do love God. Gathered sunsets make life’s trail
ablaze with light.</p>

<p>Let no to-day become yesterday, except in the<a href="#Page_17"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;17" id="Page_17"></span></a>
calendar, as we reckon time. Each day must
become part of us as we live in an ever-present
now. The same alphabet we learned in childhood
is ours to-day. Because we did not forget
it with the setting of the sun, it served us to-day
as we spell out, in polysyllables, a newly discovered
truth. The alphabet did not fade with
the death of the day we learned it, so that it is
now part of our lives. As we cannot think apart
from the words we learned long ago; and as we
cannot calculate, save as we use the first-learned
characters from one to ten; so, in the developing
of the soul, we must not lose one single hour of
prayer or inspiration of a noble purpose.</p>

<p>Both building and growing are alike in this—they
are processes of “adding to.” Brick added
to brick and timber added to timber means a
stately building. Cell added to cell means
growth of body and increase in stature. But
handling brick is not enough, they must be
placed with a purpose and kept firmly fixed in
the place desired. The brick of yesterday must
be where it can have added to it the brick of
to-day. Physical growth depends upon the keeping
the cells of yesterday for a foundation upon
which to build the cells of to-day. Christian
living is similar. We build a character and grow
a soul but the process is the same, with both
character and soul. We gain by adding to.<a href="#Page_18"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;18" id="Page_18"></span></a>
Therefore we must not permit any of our sunsets
to fade away. All that we have gained through
prayer and Christian service must be held to
brighten each new morn. The spiritual victory
over temptation, the answer to our intercessory
prayers, the moment of spiritual illumination as
we read the Bible, all these are priceless experiences
upon which to add the newer conquests
of to-day. We must not permit the disease of
sin to sap our vitality and destroy the growth
of yesterday. We must guard our spiritual
health that we may grow. This is what Christ
meant when he said: “Men ought always to
pray.” The culture of the soul is an eternal
process. Days must not pass; they must remain
as part of our own selves.</p>

Beyond the Curtained Clouds</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">One</span> of the rarest treasures of the May time
is the richness and purity of the sky. The winter
wraps the heavens in robes of somber hue as
though in mourning for the summer dead; but
at the coming of the first white cloud, and sound
of first lark’s song, the sky seems to melt in
tenderness, and assume the softest, richest hue
of blue. As far as the eye can reach there is
nothing but blue—soft, rich, warm, tender,
melting, soul-entrancing blue. Blue, as clear as
an unshadowed midland lake. Blue as a translucent
sapphire without a flaw to disturb its
gleaming surface. A great arch of caressing
tenderness through which the white-flecked
clouds ride in state, as they sail majestically
from one port of mystery to another port of
mystery. Among the richest treasures of the
spring must be mentioned the deepening of the
blue and the hanging of the snow-white curtains
of the clouds.</p>

<p>But life’s horizon is ever draped with rich
folds of white and blue, that hang like silken
curtains, to hide, with tantalizing secrecy, the<a href="#Page_20"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;20" id="Page_20"></span></a>
mysteries that lie beyond. Day by day the
curtains hide their treasure-chests of mystery,
tempting us to strike tents and journey toward
them. With the eagerness with which little children
watch the unwrapping of a Christmas
package we watch the moving of these clouds,
trusting that each new shifting of the curtains
will make the coveted revelation, but as we
journey on they still evade us.</p>

<p>Conservative people, ones who never startle
themselves or their friends by doing anything
new, not that they are averse to doing anything
new but simply because they are not mentally
capable of entertaining new ideas, say that the
mysteries that lie behind the curtained clouds
are childish fancies and youth’s illusions; and
that energy expended in reaching the buried
treasure at the rainbow’s end were as fruitful an
enterprise. Those of us who have endeavored to
solve these mysteries know better, for we have
found that the curtained clouds that hide, are
the ones that, like banners, guide us to the
things we really need.</p>

<p>Man must not be unmindful of the ministry of
mystery. Over against everything enigmatic
God has given man an insatiable desire to find
out the hidden meaning. Yielding to that
divinely implanted impulse develops powers
that otherwise would atrophy. Behold the<a href="#Page_21"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;21" id="Page_21"></span></a>
benefits of these endeavors as they lifted the
human race out of stagnation and taught it the
way of progress. Tented in the low swamplands,
eating roots and bark, man saw these
curtains that suggested to his hunger-pinched
body the thought of a banqueting-hall where
he might feed. His quest never brought him to
the ladened tables of his desire, but as he
journeyed he found grain and fruits and nuts
and berries, substantial food for a full twelvemonth.
Dwelling amid the sick and dying, man
saw the moving of the curtains that God hangs
along our sky-line, and felt that, somewhere,
beyond their folds, must exist a spring, whose
living waters would not only heal the sick but
give the drinker perpetual youth. The spring
was never found, but as man journeyed westward
in the quest he found a land whose liberties
and institutions crowd a century of blessings
into every decade. Toiling with small recompense,
like some dull beast of burden, man saw
the clouds that suggested a palace of ease and
luxury. He failed to find the palace of his
dreams, but on the way he discovered labor-saving
machinery that has made his labor a
delight, and given to every laborer a home surpassing
in comforts the baron’s stately castle.</p>

<p>Because of the ministry of mystery he has
been able to discover the depth and values of his<a href="#Page_22"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;22" id="Page_22"></span></a>
own soul. In his effort to reach the curtained
clouds man has had to rally his forces, and, to
meet arising exigencies, he has been compelled
to draw upon the resources of his nature, until
he startled himself with his newly discovered
possibilities and powers. He trained his body to
wrestle against physical odds; he trained his
mind to master the handicaps of ignorance; he
found the glittering sword of courage with which
to destroy defeating fear; he learned the value
of faith and hope with which to enrich the soul
when disaster would impoverish. Without the
effort aroused by the cloudy curtains of mystery,
he could not have found himself, and perfected
his work of invention, art and letters.</p>

<p>The cloud curtains are also the temple curtains
beyond which men are ever seeking God.
As the pillared cloud led Israel victoriously
through troubled waters and desert sands, so the
mysteries of life and death, and the natural
world in which we live, have led the human
mind to religious contemplation. Man found
himself entangled in the maze of sin, helplessly
confused amid the ways that wound about, and
crossed, and led to still more hopeless entanglements.
Despair pointed to the narrow, tangled
ways and said, “There is nothing better.” Looking
upward, the distant clouds spoke of a larger
world and greater freedom, and beckoned man<a href="#Page_23"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;23" id="Page_23"></span></a>
to try again. By faith he was saved. To a
thoughtful, reverent man, all nature reveals and
conceals the One who brought it into existence.
An awakened soul will never be satisfied until he
finds God. He longs to see the Hand that parts
the curtains and hurls the lightnings. He yearns
to see the Face whose smile fills the sky with
sunlight, and transfigures the cloudy curtains,
until they become the portals of the heavenly
temple. While mystery is not the mother of
religion, it is, and ever has been, an important
part of the Christian faith. “It is the glory of
God to conceal a thing,” says King Solomon.
He might have added, “It is the glory of man to
search until he find it.”</p>

<p>It was from behind the curtained clouds that
God spoke, introducing Jesus as the world’s
Redeemer, saying, “This is my beloved Son,
hear ye him.” It was an overhanging canopy of
cloud that curtained the disciples on the Mount
of Transfiguration, and it was in this curtained
tabernacle that they beheld the glory of their
Lord. To hide the shame of those who crucified
His Son, God hung a curtain of cloud about the
sun, enveloping Calvary in the shades of night.
It was a curtain of cloud that hid the ascending
Lord from the sight of the wondering, astonished,
fear-filled disciples. It was from amid
their soft drapery that the angels spoke of his<a href="#Page_24"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;24" id="Page_24"></span></a>
coming again, and it is upon the clouds that the
Son of man shall come in his glory to judge the
nations. From the glory of the Patmos vision,
John exclaimed, “Behold he cometh with
clouds; and every eye shall see him!” To the
very end Christ is surrounded with the curtained
clouds of mystery. “And I looked, and behold
a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sat like
unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. And he
that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the
earth, and the earth was reaped.”</p>

<p>Mystery has a large part in the Christian
faith, not to discourage, but to encourage the
prayerful, aspiring souls of men. The drapery of
cloud hangs all about, not to defeat, but to
challenge. It is no illusion like a great desert
distance filled with the blue of emptiness, that
strews the sands with the bones of those whom
it deceives, but is as real as the curtains of the
ancient tabernacle that held the symbol of Jehovah’s
presence. Life’s mysteries are often
most tantalizing; its problems artfully made
difficult of solution; but always within their
depths is God.</p>

<p>To-day, for our development, it is the glory
of God to conceal a matter, but it is the promise
that some day we shall see, not through the mists
darkly, but face to face with God. Some day we<a href="#Page_25"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;25" id="Page_25"></span></a>
shall pass beyond the cloudy portals, and the
vision of God and our own immortality shall lie
before our enraptured vision. The puzzle of life
shall there find perfect solution. The equation
in which life is now the unknown quantity shall
find its answer. In that cloudless land we shall
know even as we are known. The shadows of
death are the last shadow the soul of the
righteous shall ever see. Until that glad day
comes, let us fit ourselves, through prayer and
goodness, to receive such revelations of the
mystery of godliness as God may care to reveal
as he parts the curtains of our life’s horizon,
knowing that we journey to a perfect, unclouded
day.</p>

Tilling the Sky</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">Man</span>, that must till the soil for the building
of his body, must also till the sky for the growing
of his soul. This was the thought of a little
woman among the Ozarks, who had given a long
and beautiful life in training her people of the
hills. It was Commencement Day in the college
she had founded. Gathered about her were the
young men and young women from the humble
homes of those rugged hills. They were now
leaving her sheltering care to “commence” life.
She was such a tiny bit of woman, but through
the lens of tears in those students’ eyes, she was
greater and more stately than any queen. Her
eyes gleamed with a love-lighted moisture, her
lips trembled with great emotions as she rose to
offer her last words of counsel. She knew that
very soon they would be beyond the reach of her
voice, and her desire was to write just one more
message upon the pages of their memories, a
message that should never be erased. Breathlessly
we awaited her words, which were these:
“My children, whatever you do, or wherever
you go, this one task I place before you. Continue<a href="#Page_27"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;27" id="Page_27"></span></a>
your study of astronomy, for there is
nothing that so uplifts and widens one’s life as a
study of the sky.”</p>

<p>These were not the words of a mere dreamer,
but of a very practical woman, and were words
of wisdom uttered to young men and young
women who were practical students, yearning to
make their lives count. These students were
trained observers who would travel that they
might see things as they are; they were scholars
who would study in order to make discoveries.
They were to enter the strain and struggle of
competition. They were to match their brawn
and brain against honest rivalry and unscrupulous
dishonesty. They were not entering paradise,
yet, amid it all, the one who yearned most
for their unmeasured success and honor, urged
them to cast their plowshare deep into the wide
expanse of overarching blue, whose owner is God,
but whose harvests belong to the reaper.</p>

<p>The little woman was very practical, for a
man must not permit the narrowing influences of
earthly endeavor to cramp and destroy the soul.
This is the tendency of most of our daily duties,
even those of the most fascinating and absorbing
scientific character. A man may follow the footsteps
of Luther Burbank and devote his life to
the study of plants, and through his magic touch,
may bring beauty of form and richness of flavor<a href="#Page_28"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;28" id="Page_28"></span></a>
to bud and blossom, vegetable and fruit, and yet
the very fascination of the work may bind him
into a narrow world of just buds and blossoms,
vegetables and fruits. He may, like Edison or
Steinmetz, choose the fairyland of electricity;
or, like Madame Curé, enter the enchanted realm
of radio-activity; or, like Morse and Bell and
Davenport, become wizards in the world of
invention, and find a joy that is as perilous as it
is unutterable. Any realm of nature or invention,
absorbs and fascinates as clover blossoms
claim the bee. He who studies will find that a
lifetime is too short to fathom the unmeasured
depths of an atom or explore the mysteries of one
drop of dew.</p>

<p>But the very fascination of these things is
their peril, for the tendency of any line of endeavor
is to narrow and to restrict one’s life.
One need not yield to this tendency, but the
chances are that he will. Darwin reports spending
several delightful years studying fish-worms,
but while engaged in this absorbing task he lost
all taste for music. Ericsson had a similar experience.
Planning, with steel armor, to remake
the navies of the world, he refused his soul all
sound of blended tones, endeavoring to feed his
whole nature on armor plate. It was not until
Ole Bull, against Ericsson’s desire, entered his
factory, and began playing his violin, that the<a href="#Page_29"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;29" id="Page_29"></span></a>
great inventor became a weeping, willing captive,
kneeling at the shrine of music, tearfully
confessing that he had then found that which he
had lost, and for which his soul had been
craving. When a man, through the microscope,
begins a life study of the infinitesimal, he is apt
to get his own ego into the field of vision and
magnify himself. On the other hand, considering
only his own achievements in art or architecture,
one is apt to exaggerate his own importance
saying, “Is not this great Babylon, which I
have builded?” However, when he begins to
study the stars and comprehend something of
the vastness of the plan upon which God has
made the heaven and the earth, he will see his
own littleness and exclaim with the psalmist,
“When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy
fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast
ordained; what is man?”</p>

<p>No earth-made ceiling is high enough for a
growing brain. Each individual must have a
God-made sky in which to lift his head and think
the thoughts of the Almighty. The earthly thing
upon which we set our affection and which we
think so essential may mean the wreck and ruin
of the soul. It is easy to neglect the brain, and
direct all one’s energies toward gaining earthly
possessions, not for the opportunities afforded
for benevolence, but that one may dress in style<a href="#Page_30"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;30" id="Page_30"></span></a>
and enjoy a social life, not knowing that it is far
better to be a great thinker than to be the best
dressed man in Paris. Poverty may be infinitely
better than wealth when the individual has a
familiar sky above his head and a good book in
his hand. How insignificant are earth’s greatest
obstacles compared with the immensities of
stellar space! Nothing can hinder the man who
is accustomed to measure the distances between
stars. With his eyes on the distant suns, poverty
becomes a mole-hill; poor health, but a breath
of mist; and success is within easy reach. It is
good for one to till the sky until he learns the
vastness of his Creator’s thoughts.</p>

<p>One of the richest harvests garnered from the
sky is a revelation of the accuracy with which
God works. The stars do not dwell in a land of
“Hit and Miss,” and eclipses are not accidental
happenings. No ship cuts the waves of the sea
with half the accuracy as star and planet move
in their appointed courses. There are no swervings
nor deviations from the plan of God, so that
an astronomer can calculate the exact second
when a comet will return from its long journey
through unseen realms; as well as foretell the
conjunction of planets a thousand years from
now. God has appointed an exact second for the
rising of the sun, and another exact second for
its setting, and man knows what both of them<a href="#Page_31"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;31" id="Page_31"></span></a>
are a thousand years before the day arrives.
Then let us till the sky until we learn that He
who planned the high-arched blue, and marked
orbits for stars and planets, is also the Designer
of our own lives, and has set for us a divine
purpose somewhat like the vastness of the sky.
Yielding ourselves to God as the heavenly constellations
yield themselves to their controlling
powers, each one has a greater life to live, and a
more sublime destiny to attain, than his fondest
dreams. How foolish it is to till the soil for
money, and miss the very essence of life, by
failing to utilize the sky that yields such tender
ministries with so little effort!</p>

<p>It is well to look upward and learn a lesson of
patience, for the open sky teaches that the plans
of God are not worked out in a day. The journey
from star-dust to harvest-ladened planet peopled
by a happy family of contented men,
requires many millions of years, yet, from the
beginning it was in the mind of God. He has
never altered his plan, but with divine accuracy
the work has passed from stage to stage of
development with perfect progression. With
such an example, we must learn patience and
not become discouraged when we cannot see the
end from the beginning. A child can make a
shelf full of mud pies in one summer’s afternoon,
and they will last no longer than the first rain.<a href="#Page_32"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;32" id="Page_32"></span></a>
Hasty work means wasted effort. Life that
endures must be planned of God, fulfilled with
astronomical accuracy, and most patiently
developed.</p>

<p>How wonderful the brain that is molded after
something of the vastness of the open sky, and
how thrilling to walk and till the fields of
heavenly blue! We were meant for those
heights. It does not require a very great elevation
in the pure atmosphere of a Western State
to push back the horizon forty and fifty miles.
This planet is not the objective of life. It is
only the hilltop where God has placed us for a
little while that we may catch a vision as wide
as the universe and as high as his own White
Throne.</p>

Unquarried Statues</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">Michael Angelo</span>, with his statues of David
and Moses, proved that Phidias and Praxiteles
had not exhausted the marvelous possibilities of
the art of sculpture. Rodin, with his “Thinker,”
has shown, while Phidias and Praxiteles demonstrated
the possibility of giving immortality to
the unsurpassed beauty of Grecian form, and
while Michael Angelo revealed the power of
expressing grace, as in David, and commanding
leadership, as in Moses, that the achievements
of these two schools of art were the Pillars of
Hercules, not marking the limit of art, but the
open gateway to uncharted seas and undiscovered
realms in the art of reshaping marble.
There is not a lofty sentiment of the soul, a
struggling aspiration toward goodness, or form
of idealism that cannot be made to live in
marble, and exert undying influence. There is
more than “an angel in the block of marble.”
There are all the hopes and fears, joys and
sorrows, laughter and tears, longings and aspirations,
desires and despairs; there is all that is
manly, noble, and heroic, lying in any block of<a href="#Page_34"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;34" id="Page_34"></span></a>
marble awaiting the coming of the liberating
chisel. What inspiration to the young artist of
to-day, and what joy to all lovers of the beautiful!
The depths of earth are stored with a
wealth of unquarried statues.</p>

<p>The progress of civilization is ofttimes
hindered because youth, in thinking of statues,
consider the pedestals upon which they rest
rather than the depth from which they were
quarried. They very often do not care to begin
life at the right place. Because they covet
praise, and enjoy the warm, congenial atmosphere
of appreciation, they shun the depths,
hours of loneliness, the unrequited toil of
preparation, and the laborious efforts of beginning.
Modeling clay is an important part of
the achievement; but getting the proper marble
is one of the first essentials.</p>

<p>The experience of Michael Angelo is common
to all men of real achievement: he found that
the market place does not offer marble blocks of
sufficient size for him to work out his divine
conception. Hucksters and makers of money in
the market place seldom understand ambitious
youth that asks for larger blocks than they are
capable of handling. Their idea of a great
thought is an ornament for the mantelpiece. But
men of achievement will not be daunted. Locking
his studio, Angelo went to superintend the<a href="#Page_35"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;35" id="Page_35"></span></a>
breaking of blocks in the mountain of Carrara,
and when the sluggish-minded people of the
mountains refused to do his bidding, he opened
new quarries in Seravez. Before he could carve
his statue he knew that he must quarry a block
of marble sufficiently large. He knew also that
the block of marble could be had for the digging.
He found what he needed but did not exhaust
the treasury. The world still has the material,
richer than that which made Angelo and Rodin
famous, awaiting the youth of ambition to
undertake great things, and the willingness, at
any cost, to superintend the breaking of the
marble blocks from the buried storehouses.</p>

<p>The pleasure of nature is to store her raw
material in seemingly inaccessible strongholds.
She does not willingly yield them to men lacking
vision and great conceptions. If they were of
easy access, common men would crush them to
make roads for donkeys to tramp over. Nature’s
treasures are too valuable for ignorance to
destroy, so she locks them in secret depths or
inaccessible heights, awaiting the coming of the
man of genius. If only a man yields himself to
the divine leadings, and catches a vision of a
statue like Moses, or a façade for the Church
of San Lorenzo, or for a mausoleum for the
Medici, no mountainside is too steep to chisel
a roadway through the jagged rocks, no morass<a href="#Page_36"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;36" id="Page_36"></span></a>
so yielding but that a solid highway may be
erected, no water so troubled but that boats may
safely transport the precious marble. He will
not depend upon hirelings nor lean upon borrowed
strength. The dream of beauty must be
wrought in marble, the unquarried statue must
be lifted from obscurity and made to live in
some public place, therefore he will personally
attend to the breaking of the blocks.</p>

<p>It is not an easy matter to live out a divine
idea and make it a thing tangible and real for a
critical world to examine and criticize and afterwards
love and venerate. Sluggards and lovers
of ease cannot do it. To them an unquarried
statue is only a stone. For centuries no one has
given it any attention; why should they? They
would rather have something to eat and drink.
A cushioned chair is far more comfortable to sit
on, and a potato is much more substantial food.
What they want is something to eat, and a place
in which to lounge, and because they do not see
the value of great ideas they can never be forgotten
when dead, for they were never known
while living.</p>

<p>He lives who forgets to live and concentrates
all his powers in bringing to light the vision of
his beauty-loving soul. It may be the beauty of
art or the beauty of worthy living; it may be
the beauty of perfect workmanship in shop or<a href="#Page_37"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;37" id="Page_37"></span></a>
factory, or the beauty of a wholesome influence
flowing from noble character; it may be loveliness
of sympathetic serving, or the beauty of
aggressive battle for righteousness; it may take
any one of many forms of exalted thinking and
endeavor, yet its realization comes only when
one eats, and drinks, and bends every energy,
not for the sake of living, but for the realization
of that which is more than living.</p>

<p>How lamentable for a human life to end and
find at the final judgment that all its days were
of less value to the world than that of a coral
polyp! How wonderful for one to be made out
of dust, and after a while to crumble back into
dust, and yet, refusing to grovel in the dust,
leave the world richer, and better, and more
beautiful, so that people of another age will
breathe his name in reverence as they behold
that which he hath wrought. Professor Finsen,
the inventor of the “light cure,” was an invalid
for many years, yet he labored like a slave, in
the severest self-denial, to bring his invention,
without compensation, to the service of the
world’s sick and suffering. He had but one dread
and that was the regret of dying, and leaving his
little five-year-old boy without any memory of
his father. He desired to live long enough to
impress his face and life upon the memory of
his son, that, in the after years, the growing<a href="#Page_38"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;38" id="Page_38"></span></a>
man would never forget the one who toiled so
earnestly for him. He did not want to be forgotten.
How little did he dream of the immortality
that was his! He found an unquarried
statue in the sunbeam where others had overlooked
it. Through ceaseless toil he brought it
within the vision of the world and gained a name
that countless ages will not forget.</p>

<p>How wonderful to be the son of such a man!
And though the image of the father’s face be
blotted from the memory, the statue that he
carved will help and heal the generations. How
wonderful to be the son of such a man, but how
much more wonderful it is to be the man himself!
To fight with optimistic heart against the
ravages of disease, to overcome the natural
yearnings of a father’s heart, to endure the most
slavish toil without thought or hope of compensation,
to be a sick man fighting for others
who were sick; a dying man making battle
against disease that others may not taste of
death!</p>

<p>This is the joy unspeakable, to know that life
is not in vain, but everlastingly worth while.
The visions shall not fade as summer clouds at
twilight time, but shall live in that which is as
imperishable as marble. Each one can say with
deep resolve: “Men shall behold the beauty of
my soul by beholding the beauty of my daily<a href="#Page_39"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;39" id="Page_39"></span></a>
life. Since words are blossoms, I shall, with
gracious speech, show my friends how choice a
garden I have planted in my heart. Since every
blossom bears a seed I shall take pleasure in
planting them within the hearts of others, that
the beauty of my life may live in them. Out of
the marble block that it has been mine to break
from its hiding place, I shall carve the image I
have treasured so long within my heart.” To
do this is to find a joy unspeakable. Life is not
useless, but gloriously worth while. Eating, and
drinking, and toiling for that which is far more
than life, one can never die.</p>

The Ages to Come</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">No</span> matter how earnestly we may love our
life-calling, and rejoice in our chosen field of
activity, there are hours when the easiest task
becomes irksome and its daily repetition seems
unbearable. However healthy the soul and
robust the moral nature, a constant onslaught of
sorrow may wound like a poisoned dart, filling
the soul with painful forebodings. Beholding the
transitoriness of life, and the apparent frailty
and uncertainty of those things upon which we
place our heaviest dependence, we become depressed,
and feel that nothing is permanent and
that life’s products are but empty shadows.
These are common experiences, and their frequent
repetition does not lessen their depressive
power. Coming upon us to-day they are just as
hurtful as when they challenged us for the first
time.</p>

<p>That we may overcome these disagreeable
tendencies, and live a life victorious, Paul revealed
the secret of his own achievements. To
him work never became drudgery, sorrow never
festered or left a feverish wound, while even the<a href="#Page_41"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;41" id="Page_41"></span></a>
most commonplace incident was of the deepest
significance because he had learned to acquire
and maintain a deep perspective that placed
each moment of time in the white light of
eternity. He believed that we are not created
for the hour but for the centuries, and that we
must work not so much for the present hour as
for the years that are yet to be. The one purpose
of every word and deed, to Paul, was to “show the
ages to come the exceeding riches of God’s grace.”</p>

<p>As the prolific and luxuriant vegetation of the
carboniferous age bordered the lakes with ferns,
the rivers with reeds, and the hillsides and
valleys with gigantic trees of grotesque form,
that, in the ages to come, man might have the
exhaustless coalbeds to protect him from the
cold; as the coral polyps, buried beneath the
waves, love and labor and die, generation after
generation, until a coral island lifts its head to
receive the kisses of the passing waves and extend
the arms of a protecting harbor, that, in
the ages to come, the storm-tossed mariners may
find safe shelter against the stormy wind and
wave; so you and I are to love, and labor, and
die, not for ourselves, but that the ages to come,
through our goodness and fidelity, may behold
the riches of God’s grace.</p>

<p>This does not mean that we are to so bury
the present in the future that our lives shall<a href="#Page_42"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;42" id="Page_42"></span></a>
consist of nothing save vague dreams and idle
contemplations. It means the opposite. We are
to magnify the present and give it increasing
value by crowding it with an eternal significance.
We are not to drop to-day into the
silent ocean of the future and see it fade from
sight, but into to-day we are to crowd to-morrow
and all the other to-morrows that shall
follow. Instead of losing the drop of water in
Niagara we are to crowd all the dash and splendor
and power of Niagara into the single drop of
water; instead of losing the dew in the ocean, we
crowd the ocean into the dewdrop; instead of
burying the present into the future, we gather all
eternity and crowd it into a single lifetime, so
that every second of time becomes as precious as
a thousand years of eternity, and the smallest
task we have to perform becomes as sacred as
the songs of the angels.</p>

<p>When one possesses this conception of life
that crowds a vast eternity within the compass
of a single individual life, no toil can ever become
drudgery. Every deed has divine significance.
The most ordinary task will be performed carefully,
knowing that it must stand the scrutiny
and criticisms of the passing centuries. We
labor then with the various elements of life, as
the artists of Venice toil with their priceless
mosaics, willing to spend a lifetime of painstaking<a href="#Page_43"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;43" id="Page_43"></span></a>
endeavor in forming a single feature of a
saint, knowing that long after they themselves
have ceased to toil the wisdom of untold centuries
shall review their efforts to either praise or
blame. Hitherto we have despised the commonplace
things that fell to our hands, while we
busied ourselves searching for some great thing
worthy of our effort, with the result that nothing
has been accomplished; now we find, that that
only is truly great which is commonplace.
Divine opportunities are everywhere. In the
low-browed man upon the street we see the
possibility of an ennobled and redeemed humanity.
In the waif, crying from hunger, we see
the center of world-wide and eternal destinies.
Words are winged messengers, so we learn to
study them with care, and speak them with the
precision with which a musician strikes his
chords. Divine destinies are depending upon the
perfection with which we toil, adding a charm to
every endeavor that never fades with weariness.
There can be no drudgery to him who has a
perspective eternity long.</p>

<p>This conception of life which Paul gives us
will carry us unharmed through all the misfortunes
of life. It is impossible for us to escape
sorrow. By rigid economy we may save our
money only to have it stolen by a deceitful
friend; we may build a home, only to find it<a href="#Page_44"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;44" id="Page_44"></span></a>
purchased and occupied by another; loved ones,
more precious than our own lives, have been
lured from our side by the hand of death. These
hours are naturally dark and of tortuous length,
and if it were not for the fact that we have
learned to think in terms of eternity, we would
die of a broken heart. But we do not die; we
pass through them with triumphant tread. The
soul sobs but does not bleed; the heart hurts but
does not break. We are not living for this world
alone; our horizon has been widened because we
have been lifted to a higher level; we can now
see two worlds; our faith sweeps onward as far
as God can think. The earthly home for which
we planned and toiled has passed into the hands
of another, but we rejoice in the knowledge that
we have a home, not made with toiling, blistered
hands of earth, but one eternal in the heavens.
Our loved ones no longer greet us at the table or
occupy their accustomed places in the family
circle, but we have not lost them forever. They
have simply passed from time into eternity, and
because we also are the children of eternity, they
are still our own, and we shall see them once
again. Thank God for the transforming power
that comes into every human life when, by
divine aid, one crowds eternal significance into
his days, and works, not for himself, but for “the
ages to come.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_45"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;45" id="Page_45"></span></a></p>

<p>Paul’s view of life enables us to find perfect
satisfaction in working with the frailties of time
in building that which is immortal in character
and service. Possessed with such a purpose, the
spider’s web becomes a cable, dust becomes
slabs of marble, and seconds becomes decades.
There is nothing more fragile than a word,
spoken in stammering weakness, but with a
trembling desire to be of service, yet out of one
word fitly spoken may be created an influence
that sweeps heaven and earth. A faltering word
of Christian testimony was spoken by a godly
man made weak by an unconquerable embarrassment,
but his utterance proved mighty.
Lodging in the heart of Charles Spurgeon, it
started him on his wonderful career that is yet
shaking all Christendom. The smile of the face
is far more delicate than the frailest blossom that
opens its soft petals in obedience to the caressing
influence of the sun, for its existence is but for
the fraction of a second; yet one kindly, love-illumined
look has been the force that has lifted
multitudes of mortals out of despondency and
uselessness, and made them the creators of
mighty moral and religious forces. It was a
smile that saved John G. Wooley for the cause
of temperance. A smile, and a word, and the
gift of a handkerchief were all that Frances E.
Willard used to redeem one of the most notorious<a href="#Page_46"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;46" id="Page_46"></span></a>
characters of Chicago, and make her one of
God’s ministers of light among the fallen.</p>

<p>When one learns to live with the light of
eternity flooding his pathway there is not an
event in life so small and insignificant that he
cannot employ it to create, and afterward use it,
to sustain eternal influences. There is joy now
in living for Christ, but let us live, not for that
joy alone, but that, in the ages to come, we may
show the exceeding riches of God’s grace. Let
them, through us, behold what the grace of God
can do to save, to keep, to empower, and to
make immortal such sin-smitten ones as we
have been. This is the secret for making toil
pleasant, sorrows helpless, and the humblest
effort an enterprise of such character as crowds
earth with richer meaning, and fills the heavens
with new-found joys. Show them that the
greatest of all known forces is a Christ-filled
life.</p>

The Unlocked Door of Truth</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">History</span> has proven that the power of the
“All Highest” War Lord is as weak as a baby’s
arm compared with the power of the humblest
individual who has entered into and taken
possession of some great truth. A thousand
lords and ladies were gathered within the
Babylonian palace which was ablaze with light
and filled with music. All hail to King Belshazzar!
His praises were upon every lip. All honor
to the royal family that had lifted the hanging
gardens above the low-lying plains, who had
swung gates of bronze and planned the mightiest
city in the world. Every lip praised and every
heart feared the power of the daring king. But
when the finger of God wrote a message of fire
upon the palace walls it was no longer Belshazzar
who was ruler. The fate of king and lord and
ladies was in the hand of Daniel. He alone of
that great throng had seen and entered into the
truth of temperance and self-control. Such was
the sustaining power of that possessed truth
that when the man-made king trembled, and a
nation crumbled into oblivion, he alone stood<a href="#Page_48"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;48" id="Page_48"></span></a>
unmoved and triumphant amid the wreck and
chaos.</p>

<p>Before the throne of ecclesiastical autocracy
the rulers of the nations bowed in weakness and
everlasting shame. The autocracy of superstition
is the most merciless and deadly known, but
when the power of Rome was at the zenith of
her unscrupulous reign, Martin Luther, a common
man with uncommon sense, discovered and
entered into the great truth that “the just shall
live by faith.” Entering into that truth, he
found a power before which the claims of the
Pope became insignificant, and by his boldness,
brought religious liberty to the people, thus
gaining universal love and immortality.</p>

<p>Mary was Queen of England, and with that
overzeal of religious bigotry, was ruling with unquestioned
power and severity. Hugh Latimer
was only a humble preacher, one of the least of
the queen’s subjects, living among the poor, but
beside him, Queen Mary sinks into everlasting
contempt. The robes of fire wrapped his body
in their golden folds, hiding him forever from
the sight of man, but the world has not forgotten
him. His dust knows no burial place, but because
he lived in the sheltering tabernacle of a
great truth he will live forever in the hearts of
those who love religious tolerance, while the dust
of Mary crumbles in the gruesome vault at<a href="#Page_49"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;49" id="Page_49"></span></a>
Westminster Abbey, with no lip to sing her
praises to the passing generations. Royal or
ecclesiastical power is nothing compared with
the enduring authority of a common man who
has found, and entered into, and wholly and
completely lives a great eternal truth of God.</p>

<p>Truth incarnate in human life is almighty, but
truth in the abstract is as helpless as is the dust
of the Egyptian highways, which witnessed the
world’s mightiest pageants, but which are unable
to tell the story of mighty armies, royal
cavalcades, and kingly processions that once
tramped upon them. Truth has always existed.
However conceited a religious leader may be, no
one ever dared to presume himself the creator
of a truth. Long before the world had settled
upon its foundations, and the constellations of
stars, like chandeliers, swayed and swung their
pendants of light, all truth beat and throbbed
within the heart of the Almighty. Throughout
the beauty of verdant slope, crested wave, and
starlit sky, these words of encouragement have
ever rung: “Ye shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free.” The truths of
civilization have been in existence since creation,
yet in every century heathenism has flourished.
The truth about human freedom has always
been, yet Rameses sat upon a throne and drove
the Hebrews to their task, beating their backs<a href="#Page_50"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;50" id="Page_50"></span></a>
with knotted thongs and murdering their children;
the barons lived in palatial palaces fed in
luxury, while serfs toiled for harvests which they
could never gather, and starving, dared not
plead for a morsel of the food their toil provided;
the Sultan of Turkey reveled in orgies, flagrant
and disgusting, while humble Armenians were
torn asunder, their bleeding bodies fed to swine,
their wives and children tortured beyond belief,
while no civilized nation dared lift its hand in
protest. Truth, in itself, is not omnipotent. To
be of value, truth must be entered into and
possessed.</p>

<p>Every truth has a door. To ignorance the
door is barred and bolted. To thoughtlessness,
the door remains unseen. Only to the eye
trained with prayer, faith in God, and love for
man, is given the vision of these bright portals,
and the possession of the key by which he can
unlock the door and enter into and enjoy the
truth, which the world has long known by heart,
but which had never enveloped, sheltered, and
controlled their lives. If he has the courage to
use the key and open the door and enter in, he
shall not only feel the saving power of God, but
he shall leave an open way through which all
men may pass to greater power. If he refuses
to unlock the door, and, like the learned ones of
whom Christ spoke, carries away the key, entering<a href="#Page_51"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;51" id="Page_51"></span></a>
not in themselves and hindering those who
would enter, he becomes an exile, without home
through time and eternity.</p>

<p>That we may more clearly comprehend this
truth let us consider a chapter of American
history. Hayne had finished his classic and convincing
speech. With gracious charm he had
proclaimed the doctrine of union without
liberty, a nation of free people, half slave. The
rapt attention and tribute of silent applause
from the audience told how critical the situation
had become. Opposed to him was Daniel
Webster, America’s favorite child of genius,
whose face was as classic as a Greek god’s, and
whose commanding bearing won battles like a
general. He was a scholar of the strong New
England type, searching for the key to unlock
the truth that the nation needed, and make it
of easy access to the people. He saw that there
could be no union without universal freedom.
Hour after hour he proclaimed the truth, making
the mightiest speech the nation had ever heard,
swaying his audience back to the realm of clear
thinking. Finally, with one sentence, “Union
and liberty, now and forever, one and inseparable,”
he revealed to an awakened nation that
he had found the key that would unlock the
door of truth that the hour needed. But in his
hour of triumph, dazzled by the possibility of<a href="#Page_52"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;52" id="Page_52"></span></a>
becoming President, he refused to use the key.
To gain the solid South he uttered his fateful
speech for compromise. The North held its
breath in expectancy while New England sobbed
like one bereft of his favorite child. He who had
the key refused to enter in himself and hindered
those who would have entered.</p>

<p>But New England had another son of genius
who, on the eventful night that Webster, with
trembling fingers, tried, and failed, to pick up
the key that he had thrown away, left Faneuil
Hall with blazing, burning thoughts. He too had
found the way, but was unknown and untried.
Again he was in Faneuil Hall sitting beside
James Russell Lowell, listening to the mad
mouthings of men, who, for the money involved,
were endeavoring to rechristen Wrong and call
it Right. He had waited weary weeks, but now
he was unable to keep back his flaming indignation.
Rising, he began to speak. On the very
platform where Webster had fallen he began to
plead the right of human liberty. New England
was thrilled with hope. Here at last was a man
who not only saw the truth but was determined
to enter into it. With the confidence of a
prophet he used the key, unlocked the door and
showed a nation the way it ought to go.</p>

<p>Truth must become incarnate in man and man
must be incarnate in truth. Every Christian<a href="#Page_53"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;53" id="Page_53"></span></a>
man will testify to this. In childhood you committed
scripture which had little meaning to
your childish mind. It was not until in the after
years when sorrow came, and grief blinded the
eye, and pain wounded the heart, that the clear,
sweet voice of memory began to repeat these
verses, and what had been meaningless in childhood
became great, wholesome, sheltering,
protecting truths, in which you found all the
consolations of God.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful hour when the soul enters
into and takes possession of God’s great truth,
becomes the master of all its stored up power,
and begins to use it in the service of love. It is
a wonderful experience and need never be
delayed, for the door is easy to find. Years ago
earth was blessed by the coming of One who
worked hard at the carpenter trade, and in the
school of toil and prayer, found the way that
scholars had overlooked. Standing before kings
and earthly potentates he said: “I am the way,
the truth, and the life.” His spirit is the way
for men to live, the door through which they
pass into all truth, the life of fullest spiritual
development. Christ is the open way to every
truth. Through him men attain the proper
point of view, and, learning to obey the Father
as did he, begin to live the life triumphant.</p>

Weaving Sunbeams</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">Nature</span> is always busy weaving sunbeams,
and not one of them, like a knotted thread, is
cast from her loom. The waves cast their crystal
spray upon the sands to waste away, but not so
with the sun as he lavishly casts his beams
broadcast o’er the earth. Not one of them goes
upon a fruitless errand, and not one of them fails
to reach its intended goal. It is not that the sun
is wise in directing its energy, but because the
earth is ready to utilize, with untiring fidelity,
the gift of sunlight.</p>

<p>How abundantly the sunbeams come! The
arched sky is an upturned basket, out of which
God is pouring his wealth of sunlight upon a
thirsty, needy planet. These rays of light fall
everywhere, because they are needed everywhere.
Upon arctic snow and desert sand and
undiscovered ocean waves they fall as readily as
upon the forests of Brittany or the vineyards of
France. They place their gleaming coronets
upon the crystal brows of the Alps. They dance
and flash their jewels, as they hold carnival in<a href="#Page_55"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;55" id="Page_55"></span></a>
the Northern Lights. Even after the sun is set
they peer at us through the parted clouds and
leap at us from their hiding places in the moon.
They fall in the most inaccessible places, yet
none of them are ever wasted. As the parched
earth drinks raindrops, so the old world absorbs
sunbeams. Swifter and more powerful than the
leaping waters of a cataract are they poured
upon the earth—a Niagara, world-wide and sun-high,
with never-ceasing floods of light that
bathe each portion of the globe. They are not
piled in heaps; they do not swish and whirl,
cutting a gorge through solid rock, or form
a whirlpool to menace humanity, but the earth
absorbs them all, however rapidly they come,
and places them in her mysterious loom. Here,
in the depths, beyond our sight, the sunbeams
are woven into invisible cords that hold the
needles of all the compasses to the north that
no traveler need be lost in the forest, and no ship
perish in the sea. Here, in the depths, the sunbeams
are woven into mighty cables of electric
power that man picks up with the fingers of the
dynamo and compels to lift his burdens, pull
his trains, propel his ships, and serve him in a
thousand ways. Here, in the depths, is woven
that mysterious power that carries the wireless
message through the rocks of the mountains and
the channels of the sea, and wraps the earth in<a href="#Page_56"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;56" id="Page_56"></span></a>
a diaphanous garb that makes the wireless
telephone a possibility.</p>

<p>The world we see is but woven sunbeams. The
forests of oak are the sunbeams of yesterday,
wrought into gnarled and knotted fingers to
grasp the sunbeams of to-day and wind them on
a myriad unseen shuttles. Soon they shall appear
woven in the texture of notched leaf and
carved chalice of the acorn’s cup. The sunbeams
falling upon the tangled branches of the hillside
vineyard, are woven into buds, and leaves, and
clinging tendrils, and afterward into the rich
cluster of luscious grapes. The sunbeams fall
upon the buried seed and are woven into an
emerald lever with which the clod is lifted, into
sturdy leaves that are chemical laboratories
where crude sap is changed into milk, into heads
of golden wheat with which to feed a thoughtless,
hungry world. Sunbeams are woven into
corn and oats, into apples and peaches, into nuts
and berries. Falling along the railroad grade,
they are woven into violets; falling in the
swamps, they are woven into buttercups; falling
in the thicket, they are woven into the silken
folds of the wild-rose petal.</p>

<p>As nature weaves the sunbeam and not the
shadow so man ought to develop his power of
utilizing happiness and joy. The sunshine of life
ought not to be thrown away like confetti and<a href="#Page_57"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;57" id="Page_57"></span></a>
ribbon papers on a gala day. Thoughtlessly our
youths and maidens dance and sing in giddy,
senseless manner, throwing away sunbeams as
though their lives were only bits of colored glass
through which the light of joy and happiness
should pass. Having no looms with which to
weave their sunbeams into that which would
adorn their souls with garments of ever-growing
life, they soon become old and haggard, lifeless
and dead, a burned-out planet like the moon,
unable to appreciate the sunlight that never fails
to fall. Much of the difference between men
is due to the ability of one and the inability of
the other to make the passing joys of life become
a permanent, abiding element of his life.</p>

<p>There is no life without sufficient sunlight to
weave a gracious personality. Wholesomeness
of character is not the result of partiality on
God’s part, neither is hideous irritability of disposition
occasioned by God’s neglect of one
of his children. The difference between wholesomeness
and unwholesomeness of character is
that of the right and wrong use of the blessings
which God bestows upon all alike. He who casts
his sunbeams away will find old age desert and
lifeless, while he who weaves them all into a
pleasing personality, will always experience the
joy of a more abundant life. A smile is softer
than a silken fiber and wears far longer. Its<a href="#Page_58"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;58" id="Page_58"></span></a>
colors never fade, nor pass out of style. Woven
into a robe of genuine cheerfulness the soul
possesses rich adornment. These are the individuals
whom children love, men seek to honor, and
all the world respects. A king’s robe is commonplace
compared with the attractive vesture of a
healthy, cheerful disposition which anyone may
weave out of sunbeams, with which God crowds
even the most secluded, humble lives.</p>

<p>This occupation is also the secret of sound and
vigorous influence. All men possess the power
of influence, but even when one has the best
intentions he may wield a harmful, baleful influence
because of an irritable and complaining
disposition. A petulant temper and irascible
disposition are the thunder that curds much of
the milk of human kindness, and an application
of alum will not tend to sweeten the curd. With
a sharp tongue one may be driven to hard labor,
but the wounds he carries in his heart will prevent
him from performing a perfect task. Scolding
and fault-finding have driven multitudes into
iniquity. It is difficult to drive bees, but one can
lure them any distance with a field of blooming
clover. By forgetting to weave sunbeams into
wholesome character one not only loses the joy
of being cheerful but fails in one of the supreme
objectives of life—that of wielding intelligently
a helpful, healthy, and enduring influence.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_59"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;59" id="Page_59"></span></a></p>

<p>The secret of achievement may also be
described as weaving sunbeams. In a victorious
life the blessings of God take permanent place
in the work of hand and brain. Such a life is a
loom which receives only that he may produce,
the quality of the production depending upon
the care and patience with which he works, indifference
producing mediocrity, carefulness
leading to perfection. What the world calls
genius is simply the mastery of the gracious art
of weaving sunbeams into polished sentences,
enduring thoughts, embroidered tapestry, living
poem, inspiring painting, and graceful statue.
The way out of mediocrity is to weave one’s
personal blessings into world-wide benefits.</p>

<p>Here also is found the way to overcome life’s
obstacles. A frown never wins a battle. It was
a singing army that crossed the sea and helped
win the World War. Amid the dangers, hardships,
and privations our soldiers gathered sunbeams,
and with a cheerfulness never before
witnessed upon a field of battle did their full
part. Trenches, barbed-wire entanglement,
and treacherous pitfall are nothing to one who
weaves his sunbeams into song. Thus all difficulties
fade away and vanish.</p>

<p>These statements are only another way of
saying that one should weave God into every
fiber of life. The sun is always emblematic of the<a href="#Page_60"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;60" id="Page_60"></span></a>
Father, and he who weaves sunbeams will know
and love God. This is no idle saying, nor a bit
of rhetoric, but a soul-saving truth. It is the
sun that banishes the shadows; it is God who
enables us to overcome our temptations, pain
and sorrow. The more we utilize his revelations
the brighter the pathway, until at last we shall
stand in his presence and have no more need of
the sun, for we have him. “They shall hunger
no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall
the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the
Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall
feed them, and shall lead them into living
fountains of waters: and God shall wipe all tears
from their eyes.” Weaving sunbeams in a world
of shadows, we prepare ourselves for the unshadowed
land where God is the everlasting
Light. There, without sin or suffering, we shall
know God.</p>

The Pathway of a Noble Purpose</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">As</span> the sleepless eye thirsts for the dawn, and
the troubled child hungers for the sound of its
mother’s voice, so each growing soul seeks a
coveted goal the attaining of which, to him,
means success. As boys, to be boys, must dream
their dreams of strife and conflict upon a battle’s
front, and girls, to be girls, must dream their
milder dreams of love, so coming maturity demands
of each aspiring soul that he linger long
upon the visions of strife that lead to success.
It is well to seek for great things, for each success
that enters the golden portals of our lives
brings many chariots filled with golden gifts.
Returning to his home, the Roman victor was
honored with a triumph in which, on golden
plate and velvet spread, the trophies and spoils
of conquest were displayed. In this way the
ambitious Roman youth learned that success is
always attended by a great procession of rich
rewards. The one who conquers feels more than
the soul-thrill of victory. Like Samson, he finds
the unexpected reward of a carcass filled with
honey awaiting his hungry lips.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_62"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;62" id="Page_62"></span></a></p>

<p>While success is worthy of one’s best efforts,
and all men hunger for it, very few, indeed, have
ever reached that happy goal. They failed because
they refused to follow the pathway of a
noble purpose. They believed that success was
altogether a matter of outward form. Seeing
the conqueror riding in triumphant procession,
they thought that the applause arose, not because
he had conquered, but because he wore a
helmet and a shield. Hurrying to an emporium,
they too purchased helmets and shields and
strutted forth to win a world’s applause. Foolish
souls! The public eye is keen and penetrating
and always apprehends the truth. If the people
greet a king with shouts, it is not because they
see a gleaming crown, but because they recognize
a royal soul beneath the crown. If the
multitude cheer a warrior, it is not because he
bears a standard, but because, in courageous
conflict, he won a battle for the people. Spain
greeted the discoverer of America, not because
of the grain and fruit he brought, but because
he had braved the dangers of a dark unknown,
and blazed a pathway through untracked
wastes.</p>

<p>History repeats the story of a weird Scythian
custom. When the head of a house died his
family would adorn his corpse in finest raiment,
place it in a chariot, and, amid shouts and<a href="#Page_63"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;63" id="Page_63"></span></a>
hosannas, draw it to the homes of former friends.
Coming to each dwelling place, the corpse would
be greeted with pomp and splendor. For the
final home-coming the steps would be carpeted
with silken shawl and choice embroidery, while
lighted chandeliers flashed welcome to the dead
and sunken eyes. Within the doorway the
crowned corpse was placed at the head of a
banqueting table at which his gay companions
sat and made merry, eating and drinking in his
honor. Thus many days were spent in honoring
the dead before the body was laid away in the
tomb. To us it was a most gruesome custom, but
each Scythian youth struggled to possess a home
of his own, that some day he might be carried as
a crowned corpse through the city streets, and
finally, be seated in honor at his own banqueting
board.</p>

<p>This ancient custom was the outgrowth of a
mistaken view of life still prevailing in many
quarters, for the crowned corpse is seen to-day
in many public gatherings. What else is the man
who seeks office for the selfish purpose and
pleasure of holding office? In youth he saw the
governor’s chair or Senate seat, and found that
every chord of his nature was awakened and
longed to reach that goal. He determined that
this vision of his soul should be transcribed from
the pages of his imagination to the pages of his<a href="#Page_64"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;64" id="Page_64"></span></a>
nation’s history. Two pathways opened. The
one of a noble purpose, saying, “Seek office, that
you may render needed service to your fellow
countrymen.” The pathway of selfishness
opened its portals saying, “Seek office for the
sake of gain.” Seeing that trickery and deceit
promised the easier way to gain his end, he
started with leaps and bounds. He cast lots with
dishonesty and dissipation. He became a perjurer,
a liar, and a thief. He sold himself to an
unworthy cause, at last the coveted crown was
his. To-day he sits at the head of the table, not
a great ruler, but a crowned corpse. In his
struggle for power he lost all that constitutes
real living.</p>

<p>What else is the man who seeks wealth for the
sole sake of having money? For years he has
lived the life of a slave, denying himself beauty,
music, books, devotions, and benevolence, until,
at last, his name appears in Bradstreet marked
“AA,” and the world greets him as a king. Who
is he? A crowned corpse. When he began his
career two pathways opened. The one of a noble
purpose saying, “Make money for the sake of
doing good.” The other way, the way of selfishness,
saying, “Make money to satisfy your own
desires.” He chose the latter way. He has his
robe and crown, and is seated amid light and
applause, but he is not capable of appreciating<a href="#Page_65"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;65" id="Page_65"></span></a>
its meaning. Long ago he died to honor, and
truth, and love, and generous impulse. He
knows not the meaning of life.</p>

<p>Among the crowned corpses should also be
mentioned those who follow society for society’s
sake. Through imitation they have destroyed
personality. They have smothered their souls
under the weight of their self-adornment. In
their wild search for physical pleasure all the
radiant, sparkling glory of a cultured spirituality
has faded into the pallor of death. They are
richly robed, they ride in state, receive the
plaudits of their followers, sit at table spread
with gold and silver plate, but they are now
dead to all the higher things of life and are unable
to appreciate the empty honors they
receive.</p>

<p>The secret of successful living is to follow the
pathway of a noble purpose. At first the path
may seem a long and arduous one, but it is the
only way that has booths in which to rest the
weary feet and crowns for living souls to wear.
It is in this pathway that one learns the secret
of the Christ life, for as he journeys on the way
to nobility a voice is ever whispering in his
ears: “Life consists in living unselfishly. Seek
power only that you may have strength to serve
those who are weak. Gain wealth only that you
may be able to multiply your usefulness.” The<a href="#Page_66"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;66" id="Page_66"></span></a>
road of a noble purpose leads to a throne, not
one for the dead body, but a throne for the living
soul. Here too is applause, not such as the
Scythian dead received but such as was accorded
the Roman conqueror. What a thrill follows
noble endeavor! What a joy to come to old age
having fought battles for those who were too
weak to fight for themselves, and brought victory
where otherwise his people would have
suffered defeat and death!</p>

<p>The world honors those who honor it. The
ruler who has followed the pathway of a noble
purpose is always honored by his people. Before
him is spread the banquet of a nation’s reverence
and homage. The man who, in getting money,
has kept his hands clean from dishonesty, made
just returns for all labor he required, and has
kept his heart tender toward his fellow man, is
honored by everyone. Men delight to fill his
days with happiness, as honeysuckle loves to fill
the air with sweetness. When the world discovers
a woman whose desire for society is not to
satisfy her vanity, or fill a shallow soul with
selfish pleasures, but her desire is to scatter
jewels of love and gems of inspiration to make
rich and beautiful the lives of the common folk,
it crowns her in the temple of its heart and calls
her an angel sent of God.</p>

<p>The days of autocratic power are ended, but<a href="#Page_67"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;67" id="Page_67"></span></a>
the hands of the people are busy building
thrones and weaving crowns of gold. So long as
there is a love for nobility in the human heart
men and women of nobility will be placed in
power. Life consisteth not in the abundance of
the <em>things</em> which a man possesseth but in following
the pathway of a noble purpose.</p>

Swords for Moral Battles</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> best weapons with which to fight moral
battles have already been forged, sharpened, and
polished, waiting to be unsheathed for conflict.
There are some things that the ingenuity of man
cannot improve. Man’s genius may perfect the
locomotive to give swiftness to his feet; it may
magnify his voice until his whispers are heard a
thousand miles away; it may perfect machinery
giving speed and accuracy to his busy fingers;
it may print his speech and multiply his audience
a millionfold; it may open new fields of
endeavor, thus increasing the circle of his influence;
it may do many things to break down
barriers, and increase usefulness; but all the
genius and skill of man can never devise nor
contribute to any life a better or keener weapon
with which to fight moral battles than belonged
to us the eventful morning we left the old homeplace
and mother’s presence, to begin, among
strangers, our first conquest with the world.</p>

<p>As a royal exile David was facing a grave
crisis. The relentless enemy was pressing hard,<a href="#Page_69"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;69" id="Page_69"></span></a>
and he possessed no means of defense. Leaving
his hiding place, he hurried into the presence of
Ahimelech and asked for a spear or a sword. As
Ahimelech was a priest, and not a warrior, he
was about to dismiss the young man empty-handed
when, suddenly, he remembered.
Wrapped in cloth, hanging behind the high
priest’s robe, was an old sword, the very one that
this young man had one time taken from the
stiffening fingers of a dying giant, whom he had
slain on the eventful morning of his first great
conflict. Slowly and carefully the old man took
the gleaming blade from its resting place, unwrapped
it with reverent touch, explaining that
it was all that he had to offer. David was instantly
filled with delight. His eyes gleamed
with fire, his heart and soul were thrilled with
memories of that bright morning, when, filled
with the ardor of youth, he had run down the
mountainside to make conquest with the giant.
This was that giant’s sword! The very one that
he had wrenched from the stiffening fingers of
the vanquished foe. Reaching forward he
grasped it in his strong right hand saying:
“There is none like that; give it me.” There
may have been and probably were better and
more beautiful swords in the world; keener
steel may have been forged into swords for the
generals and kings of other lands, but for David<a href="#Page_70"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;70" id="Page_70"></span></a>
there was none other quite so efficient as the one
with which he had gained his first victory.</p>

<p>There are no newly discovered weapons with
which to fight the moral battles of to-day. As
David was aroused from the shrinking spirit of
a fugitive to become a conquering king, by being
given the weapon of his former battle, so each
man must make requisition upon the past.
Behold the weapons which hang in the sacred
temple of our souls awaiting the grasp of a
courageous hand.</p>

<p>There is the sword of our childhood dreams.
Let memory make you a little child again with
brother and sister about the hearthstone on a
winter’s evening, and let your heart glow with
good cheer. Or let the sunshine of summer fall
across your way until you are a child once more,
running with bare feet through the winding ways
of the meadow, chasing moths and butterflies, or
wading the stream back of the old schoolhouse,
your heart as carefree as the rippling waters.
Let the dull monotonous hum and soothing
influences of those happy days of wonderment
come back to your heart until your eyes half
close and you begin redreaming your youthful
dreams. Blessed dreams, that cause the muscles
of your face to relax, while laughter comes to the
lips, and compels you to forget the blistering
ways you have trodden since those sun-bright<a href="#Page_71"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;71" id="Page_71"></span></a>
days. Dream your dreams of tenderness and
confidence, for the tendency of the city is to
harden the heart and dull the sympathies. Then
will you have a worthy weapon with which to
make battle. You need your old-time faith in
God and confidence in man, your former optimistic
view of life that gave brightness to every
future fancy; your trustfulness in mother’s love
and father’s counsel; the belief that divine power
was working for your success because your heart
was pure; let these memories and fond dreams
come to you once again. You need them. Without
the dreams of life the arm has little strength
and the will but little power. Let them come
back, bringing smiles for your face, and wreaths
for your brow, and heaps of gold for your coffers.
Youthful dreams must never fade from the
gallery of memory if men would achieve. Lay
hold upon them with all your power, knowing
that while manhood’s wisdom is valuable, it is
not half so effectual in fighting life’s battles as
are the warm dreams of youth. With the sword
of a worthy dream a man can defeat any adversary,
scale any rampart, take any stronghold.
Youth’s dreams were never intended to be lost.
They are stored away in the most sacred part
of your nature. Plead for their return, and finding
them, exclaim with David, “There is none
like that; give it me.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_72"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;72" id="Page_72"></span></a></p>

<p>There is the sword of your old-time enthusiasm
and resolution. There was a time when you
believed yourself the possessor of a divine
quality that would compel your brightest
dream to come true. With age you are becoming
more prosaic. You are not so confident and
self-assertive. You excuse your shortcomings by
asserting that you are becoming “more conservative,”
forgetful that conservatism is very
often only a refined name for dry rot or petrification.
No man can win a fight with merely the
weapons of conservatism. What you need is the
old-time enthusiasm with which you announced
your determination to leave home, the enthusiasm
with which you packed the old trunk, and
that fired your soul as you drove away from the
old homestead, and made you determined to
win fame and fortune at any cost. Time instead
of deadening should kindle the fires of enthusiasm.
You are living in the greatest hour of
history. You are better equipped and environed
and protected than the people of any generation.
The quest was never so valuable; the rewards
for noble endeavor never more abounding.
There is no reason for any man giving up to indifference
or despair. Take up your old-time
enthusiasm until your heart burns with power
that quickens the step and strengthens the arm.
Lay hold of this conquering sword with which<a href="#Page_73"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;73" id="Page_73"></span></a>
you have slain many a giant and cry with the
spirit of a true conqueror, “There is none like
that; give it me.”</p>

<p>There is the sword of your childhood faith in
God. As you have grown older you have
acquainted yourself with many theories and
tried many dogmas strange and fanciful, but
none of them have had sufficient strength and
keenness to win your battle. You have been
compelled to throw them aside, and now, in the
crisis, you are compelled to face the enemy of
your soul without means of defense. Then take
up the sword of your childhood faith in God that
filled your younger years with beauty, that
warmed your enthusiasm, and made you fight
single-handed while an army trembled. Kneel
once more as you knelt at your mother’s knee;
look up with an open face toward your Father
in heaven; cherish his words and keep his commandments;
and from this hour no man can
defeat you. In the outstretched hand of your
Christian mother is the sword of your old-time
faith in God. May you have the wisdom of
David when he saw the sword in the hands of
the priest and exclaim with all the earnestness
of your repentant soul, “There is none like
that; give it me.”</p>

<p>There is no modern improvement in making
swords for moral battles. Man’s progress in the<a href="#Page_74"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;74" id="Page_74"></span></a>
sciences is not because he has improved but
because he has employed the laws of nature,
laws that have coexisted with the world. The
telephone, telegraph, and incandescent are not
the result of man inventing electricity. Science
wins all her conquests by using old swords but
perfect ones, because they come from the hand
of God. We need no new religions, cults, or
creeds. Being man-made they have no excellence
of steel or temper. The emphasis must be
placed, not upon the theory, but upon the moral
laws which are just as vital to the spiritual life
as natural laws are to the development of
science. These laws are perfect. The Ten Commandments
are incomparable. Not one of them
is unnecessary but each one vital to triumphant
living. Add to these the new commandment of
Christ that we are to love the Lord our God with
all our mind and heart and soul and strength
and our neighbors as ourselves, and we have an
arsenal with which to conquer all the powers of
earth and hell.</p>

<p>The world is weary following the ways of men.
Righteousness alone exalteth a nation. “Back
to God!” is the war-cry. “There is none like
that; give it me.”</p>

Spiced Wine</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">In</span> his Songs Solomon referred to a beautiful
Oriental custom. The bride and bridegroom
drank from the same cup, that they might show
the assembled guests their willingness to henceforth
share all the cups of life, whether sweet or
bitter. To add to the joy of the wedding banquet
the cup from which the wedded ones were to
drink would be passed first to the others who
were seated with them. As it passed from hand
to hand each guest would drop into the ruby
wine a gift of fragrant spice, expressing thus
the earnest wish that every bitter cup of life
might be brightened and sweetened with the
spices of good friendship. From the first moment
of wedded life their loved ones wished that they
taste of nothing save joy and happiness. In his
great poem Solomon somewhat alters the
ancient custom and represents the bride performing
this service of spicing the wine for the
husband, as much as to say, “I would render
unto thee only the sweetest, the purest, and the
best that earth can hold.”</p>

<p>One of the greatest needs of to-day is a spirit<a href="#Page_76"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;76" id="Page_76"></span></a>
of willingness to spice the sour wines which
others are daily compelled to drink. There are
few greater services to render both God and man
than to proffer the cup of spiced wine.</p>

<p>The church as the Bride of Christ should offer
to him no service that is not sweet and aromatic
with the spices of sincerity and love. This is the
only way the world will ever be taken for Jesus
Christ. The church must offer something better,
more pleasing, and more wholesome than the
wines that this world has to offer. It is the
tendency to give to God the drainings from life’s
vintage. We often spend the week in pursuit of
selfish pleasures, drinking the sweetest wines and
giving them freely to our chosen companions,
and then, in hours of worship, give to God the
cheaper, sourer wines, making religious worship
unwholesome, acrid, bitter, and nauseous.</p>

<p>Unless we do away with our acrimonious
methods and make our services to God more
aromatic and pleasant, the church is going to
lose all hold upon her boys and girls. As a child’s
growing body requires sugar, so his awakened
spiritual powers need that which is sweetened
with the spices of gladness and whole-heartedness.</p>

<p>This is the only way by which the church shall
get and retain its grip on men of affairs. All
week long these individuals have been tasting<a href="#Page_77"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;77" id="Page_77"></span></a>
the acid and the bitterness of earthly struggle
and competitive ambition. Sunday morning
comes and they are tired, and nervous, and all
worn out. What they need is a cup of spices,
each bit of spice a gift of love. They need to
have their minds taken away from the bitterness
and acidity of life and given something that is
fragrant and stimulating, something that will
revive and strengthen them for future activity.
This is the purpose of the church. It is to gather
from all quarters of the earth all things that are
good, wholesome, and attractive, and press
them, as a gift of love, to the lips of every
worshiper. It is to crowd each service with
inspiring song, short helpful prayers, warm-worded
greetings, and enthusiastic handshaking,
until the silver chalice brims with gladness.
Bring all your spices into the house of God and
offer to Christ a pleasing gift. There is no telling
how much good you can do. Look into the face
of your Creator whenever you enter his temple
and pray with an earnest heart: “O Lord, I
would this day cause thee to drink spiced wine.”</p>

<p>This should not only be the attitude of the
church toward its Lord, but it should certainly
be the spirit with which it daily faces the world.
As we confront each individual we should be
able to say: “I would cause thee, my brother,
my sister, to drink spiced wine.” We should go<a href="#Page_78"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;78" id="Page_78"></span></a>
through life so prepared with the spices of good
cheer that the moment we found one with a cup
of bitterness we could remove all its disagreeableness
before it is pressed to their parched
lips. We should carry spices for their cups, and
not pepper for the eyes, or salt with which to
rub the sores of our enemies. Spices so sweeten
the cup that men forget their hatred and find
themselves glad that we are here.</p>

<p>Give them the spices of a good disposition.
Our dispositions are not unalterable gifts thrust
upon us at birth, but are largely a matter of
cultivation. If we associate with that which is
sour and crabbed, our dispositions will, of necessity,
assume the same nature. If we live a life of
goodness, we will most naturally have a sweet
disposition. The difference between peaches
and pickles is far more than a matter of spelling.
Peaches are not pickles, because they absorb the
sunlight and the sweetness of the soil, until even
their tartness is delicious to the taste. Pickles
are not peaches because they absorb only those
things which suggest and harmonize with salt
and vinegar. We never think of pickles without
thinking about vinegar. Their difference is in
the choice of elements used in building tissues.
The same thing is true with us. We make our
dispositions, and because we do, we should be
lovers of the aromatic spices with which God<a href="#Page_79"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;79" id="Page_79"></span></a>
has crowded the world. O that those who profess
to love God would cease shaking pepper into
others’ lives, and begin to put sweet spices of a
good disposition into cups already too bitter
with the gall of sorrow and disappointment.</p>

<p>Give them the spices of a cheerful conversation.
No good comes from burning the mind
of the world with the acid of criticism, or distressing
their lacerated hearts with the story of
our personal discomforts. Give spices. Instead
of telling how the rheumatism made the joints
creak on their hinges, tell the story of how once
you were able to leap over the fences and how
you swung from the topmost branch of the old
apple tree. Instead of telling about the horrors
of insomnia, and how little you slept that past
week, and how miserably the morning hours
wore away, tell about the red bird that sang
under your window and awakened a thousand
memories of your childhood, tell how you
noticed the fresh air of the morning awakened
symphonies among the dew-laden leaves. It
is so much nicer to be a candle that gives light
than a smoky chimney that belches soot and
cinders. The world always appreciates its
bearers of good news. Happy conversation is
within the reach of every one. No matter how
blind we may be to the blessings of to-day,
memory holds a box of spices within easy reach,<a href="#Page_80"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;80" id="Page_80"></span></a>
and we can fill our words with a sweetness that
will cast an undying fragrance.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to be cheerful when we
remember that we meet only two classes of
people, no matter how far we travel, or how long
we live. The one class consists of those who are
making failure of life. Each word we speak
brings to them either the bitterness of wormwood
or the good cheer of wild honey. The opportunity
to give encouragement to the downcast
comes every day. Tired, worn, and jaded,
they meet us upon every street corner and press
against us at every assembly. O that they might
rejoice as they taste the spices we are placing in
their wine! The other class of people whom we
are meeting are those who are making success of
life, and who are very often the most neglected.
Because they receive worldly honor we think
them extremely happy, not recognizing their
loneliness. The world never hesitates to press
its sponge of vinegar and gall to the lips of those
who are serving it.</p>

<p>Several years ago there was a large gathering
in Calvary Church, New York City, to pay
tribute to Dr. Edward Washburn. Phillips
Brooks, Bishop Potter, and many other men of
distinction met in that magnificent service and
offered words of praise to the goodness, courage,
clear thinking, untainted love and unselfish devotion<a href="#Page_81"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;81" id="Page_81"></span></a>
of that mighty man. After all had ended
their words of praise a little woman, dressed in
black, who had been the companion of Dr.
Washburn for so many years of married life,
slowly arose to address the audience. Amid an
intense silence she repeated over and over again
these words: “O, if you men loved Edward so,
why did you never tell him?” What a revelation
of heart-hunger! Long years of bitterness when
all might have been relieved with just a little
spice, that is readily found and easily bestowed.</p>

<p>Bring on the spices! Let us be more affectionate
one toward another. The eldest son of a
large family was kneeling at his mother’s deathbed
saying, “You have been such a good
mother.” The dying woman opened her eyes
and faintly whispered, “You never said so before,
John, you never said that before.” Let
this be our motto as we meet all men: “I would
cause you to drink spiced wine.”</p>

The Fever of Health</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">One</span> of man’s richest possessions is the feeling
of restlessness and discontent that ever pushes
onward seeking something new. It is the secret
of discovery. Beholding the sunset, like a
thousand camp fires flashing their beams upon
the crimson and purple curtained tents of ever-encamping
angels, man determined to enter into
and share their quiet place of rest and luxury.
Hastening forward, he easily found the hills that
yester-night formed the mystic camping ground,
but nowhere would a torn leaf or trampled
grass-blade betray a single footprint; while,
looking farther westward than he had traveled,
he saw the same crimson-and-purple tents
stretched upon other hilltops bathed with sunset’s
golden light. Month followed month while
man continued journeying westward in fruitless
quest for peace, but in his effort to reach the
cherished goal he discovered new lakes and
rivers, hills and valleys, plains and forests, until
a mighty continent lay ready for his children’s
children to build cities rivaling in power and<a href="#Page_83"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;83" id="Page_83"></span></a>
splendor the mystic camps of sunset’s unseen
hosts.</p>

<p>Restlessness and dissatisfaction are the secret
of invention. Satisfied with their condition,
China, India, and Africa yield no inventions.
Their people carry water in flasks of skin, travel
upon weary-footed beasts of burden, and bequeath
their children nothing but tradition.
Such once was all the world until some individuals
of courage and determination caught the
fever of health. Dissatisfied and restless, man
became weary of carrying water and would not
rest until he had perfected the Holly Engine that
presses a cup of cool water to every thirsty lip
within the city. Tired of slow travel, he compelled
the locomotive to give fleetness to his
feet, and the telephone to give rapid transit to
his voice. Restless because the singer’s voice
must fade in silence, man built the phonograph
to give the human voice, the frailest of all man’s
possessions, everlasting life. Dissatisfaction
with things as they are gives invention her rich
achievements.</p>

<p>Art follows only in the footsteps of restlessness.
Every painting and tapestry hanging on
palace wall, every anthem that thrills the
templed throngs, and every melody that wafts its
sweet cadence upon the trembling, vibrant air,
exists because some sensitive soul refused to<a href="#Page_84"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;84" id="Page_84"></span></a>
know contentment until he had given perfect
expression to the beauty that dwelt within his
soul.</p>

<p>Only through the contagion of the divine
fever can there be any reform. It was only when
the restless soul of John Howard began to express
its contempt for the foul floors and vitiated
air of England’s jails and aroused the slumbering
conscience of an indifferent people that the cruel
prison systems of the world were changed. Reform
in England’s colonial policy that made
possible the unity of Canada and the founding
of our own government came only when men
began to chafe and grow restless under unjust
treatment, and finally found expression in the
burning, blazing, nervous eloquence of Patrick
Henry, “Give me liberty, or give me death!”</p>

<p>Because men were satisfied with things as
they were, the city slums became deeper, fouler
depths of misery entombing thousands of human
beings in inexcusable death-traps, robbing
parents of hope and childhood of its lawful inheritance
of health and goodness. These things
continued until one poor lad grew divinely restless.
A little immigrant boy of poetic temperament
and lofty aspirations, by the name of
Jacob Riis, cried out in protest against the
injustice of foul air and darkened homes. Restless
himself, he made the city restless, until New<a href="#Page_85"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;85" id="Page_85"></span></a>
York transformed her tenements, purified her
slums, and reformed her government until she
became one of the cleanest cities of the world—in
many ways a worthy example for the cities
of the Old World to follow. The restlessness of
Livingstone redeemed Africa. The restlessness
of Morris saved China. The restlessness of
Thoburn is working miracles in India. When
men found it impossible to sit at ease while their
brothers were in chains slavery disappeared.
Because men became weary with drunkenness
and tired listening to the pathetic pleading of
drunkards’ wives and children, an aroused nation
closed the open saloons and placed a ban
upon the sale of alcoholic drink. Men are now
becoming tired of war. They believe that the
world has drunk its fill of human blood. The
hour for world-wide disarmament has come, and
rulers must be made to think before sacrificing
their people’s lives.</p>

<p>Here also we find the secret of mental development.
So long as the human mind is satisfied
with tradition it cannot grow; but let it once
become uneasy under the deadening power of
superstition, its very restlessness will make the
mountains unlock their secrets, the plants yield
tribute of health-creating medicines, the clouds
unbosom their mystery, and even the starlight
becomes a pencil of gold to write upon the tablet<a href="#Page_86"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;86" id="Page_86"></span></a>
of the sky the marvelous story of man’s growing
intellectual power.</p>

<p>No one of God’s gifts is to be valued more
than this feeling of unrest that he inspires within
the heart, making us dissatisfied with ourselves
and our surroundings, and forcing us forward to
become skillful in discovery, art, invention, reform,
and intellectuality.</p>

<p>But the beneficent influence of health’s fever
does not end here, for it is also the secret of
spiritual development. We have all experienced
these seasons of holy manifestation. Our friends
said that we had the fidgets; the physician
diagnosed our case as one of nervousness; we
insisted that we had the blues; but all were
wrong. The restlessness was a sign of health.
We were not satisfied with ourselves but longed
for nobility. The dust-made body was refusing
to grovel in the dust. The spiritual life was beginning
to assert itself through these tissues of
flesh. The chrysalis had lost its desire to crawl
along the ground, for new life within claimed its
right to rise upon joyous wing and cleave the
sunlit air. It was not a thing to be despised, to
mar and gnaw the budding leaf, but something
to be admired and loved of man, something
sylphlike to sip from chalices of gold and silver,
porphyry and lapis-lazuli. The old man of sin
was dying, and through the power of Christ a<a href="#Page_87"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;87" id="Page_87"></span></a>
new man was coming into life; from now on he
can never be satisfied with things as they were.</p>

<p>One of the hopes of the world’s salvation is the
fact that sin never satisfies the soul. Its promises
are never fulfilled. Its obligations are never met
at maturity. Men become restless in their sin,
and through their restlessness are being led to
God. Here alone can satisfaction be found, for
only Christ supplies the soul with what it needs
for the journey set before it. He offers guidance,
saying, “I am the way.” Following him no soul
has ever been lost amid the bewildering maze of
sin. He offers sustaining power saying, “I am
the bread of life” and “I am the water of life.”
The dusty ashes of sin no longer choke, but for
the hunger there is life-giving bread, and for the
parched lip there is water. He gives illumination,
saying, “I am the light,” and the terrors of
darkness and the dangers of the night flee away.
He offers an open way, saying, “I am the door,”
and through him one passes out of the cramped
prison house of past sins into untrammeled, unmeasured
freedom. He offers immortality, saying,
“I am the resurrection and the life: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live.” The deadening power of sin loses its
hold, and one tastes the unspeakable joy of
living a life that is life indeed.</p>

<p>Then be not confounded by the feeling of<a href="#Page_88"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;88" id="Page_88"></span></a>
restlessness that ever creeps upon the healthy
soul. What a tragedy our lives would be had we
been satisfied with our first achievements! How
terribly pathetic it is to become satisfied with
ourselves now, while we are so far short of what
we might be, and so lamentably short of what
God meant our lives to be! Curb not the spirit
of restlessness as though it were a fever of death.
It is health’s fever. It is the call of the soul for
its Creator who longs to lead us into better
things.</p>

<p>To-morrow will be a beautiful day because
to-day is so restless.</p>

The Wisdom of the Unlearned</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> pathway of true brotherly love is
bordered with deformed social conditions which
must be faced and remedied. Entering the
temple at the hour of prayer, Peter and John
had their pious meditations interrupted by the
appealing cry of a crippled beggar, who was
crouching helplessly at the temple door. His
haggard face, his wistful eye, his bony, outstretched
hand, pleaded so passionately that the
singing of the Levites was drowned and the
temple call to prayer unheeded. The eyes of
Peter and the beggar met, and Christlike
spirituality stood face to face with the practical
aspect of the world’s need. Instantly the great-hearted,
impetuous Peter took notice of the
helpless man, whose wan face began to brighten
with hope. Taking him by the right hand, Peter
said: “Silver and gold have I none. I cannot
meet the requirements that you ask, knowing
that it is not money that you need, so much as
health and strength, with which to earn a livelihood
for yourself and for your loved ones. Silver<a href="#Page_90"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;90" id="Page_90"></span></a>
and gold have I none; but such as I have, give
I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
rise up and walk.” The cripple did not have
time to waver, nor to debate, for the warm
handclasp and the strong arm of the enthusiastic
servant of Christ was lifting him to his
feet and teaching him how to leap, and run, and
sing the praises of God. Peter and John felt
that they could not enter the temple to pray
until they had proven their right to worship by
practically meeting whatever part of the world-wide
social needs chanced, at that moment, to
confront them.</p>

<p>But their benevolence was misinterpreted by
those who should have been the most appreciative.
Overzealous religionists, who usually
mistake the form for the spirit of worship, had
the two benefactors arrested, accused of violating
their law concerning the observance of the
Sabbath day. After a night spent upon the
cold, damp stones of the inner prison, the two
disciples were brought before the learned magistrate
to explain their conduct.</p>

<p>There is nothing more interesting than these
unfriendly scholarly investigations of religious
phenomena, conducted for the purpose of securing
a rational psychological explanation. The
high priests, the scribes, the rulers of city and
province were seated in state, when the two<a href="#Page_91"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;91" id="Page_91"></span></a>
humble followers of the Social Christ, with
common garb, and net-calloused hands, stood at
the judgment bar and heard the question: “By
what power have ye done this?” A more modern
phraseology of the question would be, “State to
the Court what is the psychological explanation
of this purported miracle?”</p>

<p>It was a critical moment to these judges, for
scholarship, with much ado, was studying and
analyzing ignorance. But the Peter of Pentecost
was not to be dismayed. He knew that the
service of Christ is not formal but practical, and
that his conduct in curing a lame beggar was
more important to God than the observing of a
thousand man-made forms and ceremonies. He
knew from his former experience that ignorance
need have no fear of the scoffer’s sneer, or the
scholar’s questioning, when once the heart has
been fully consecrated to the service of God.
With confidence they faced the inquirers saying,
frankly: “The power is not ours. This miracle
was performed through the power of Christ,
which you, in your learning, threw aside, and
which we, in the simplicity of our untutored
hearts, have accepted as the gift of God.” The
power of Pentecost was with the preacher again,
and the judges were filled with fear and wonderment.
Against their most earnest desires they
liberated the men, wondering why they, as<a href="#Page_92"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;92" id="Page_92"></span></a>
learned men, should be influenced by men of
such untrained intellects.</p>

<p>While Christianity has always waged warfare
against ignorance in all forms, and has been the
leader in founding schools and colleges, the fact
remains that many of our greatest achievements
have been wrought by untrained men. God
often takes the weak things of this world to
confound the mighty.</p>

<p>When an unorganized and badly scattered
people needed a wise ruler, God passed by the
palace doors and over the seats of learning that,
in the open fields, he might crown David, a
shepherd lad. When Jerusalem was a ruined
city, overgrown with weed and briar, God
ignored commanding generals and ruling monarchs,
to honor Nehemiah, whose conquering
courage rebuilt the city. When mad with power
and wild excesses of sin, a mighty nation needed
restraint, God stepped over the royal houses as
though they were playthings upon the nursery
floor, and lifted Daniel, an exile, to become the
condemning conscience for them who had slain
their consciences, and to become a radiant hope
for those who were enslaved and had lost all
courage. When the time had fully come for the
kingdom of Christ to be preached to the
cultured and aristocratic, he chose these two
men of the fisher-craft, who, though ignorant<a href="#Page_93"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;93" id="Page_93"></span></a>
and unlearned, made the scholars and statesmen
dumb with wonderment, while the crowned
power of the age was humiliated, unable to cope
successfully against the growing faith.</p>

<p>Christianity, while not encouraging ignorance,
recognizes what the world often overlooks, that
learning, in itself, has woeful limitations. When
rightly employed, mental training multiplies
one’s powers and talents, as the circling moon
gives strength and swiftness to the rising tides;
but misapplied book-learning has little value. In
the crises of life the general information gleaned
from books counts for but very little. The
knowledge that water, when reduced in temperature
to thirty degrees or less, freezes, so that a
dangerous river is changed into a solid highway
over which one can walk in safety, is of small
value to a man who is drowning in the summer
time, and very few drowning men would call for
a thermometer to take the temperature of the
water in which they were sinking. Standing
beneath a falling wall, no man is going to begin
to calculate the specific gravity of the falling
elements or estimate the force of impact upon
his head. All learning is good, and nothing
in the line of information should be ignored,
for, along the more or less narrow line of its
own application, each truth is of inestimable
value. Each added truth that one learns pulls<a href="#Page_94"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;94" id="Page_94"></span></a>
up the tent stakes of the horizon and widens the
world just so much, but no man can save himself
with learning alone. Success depends, not
upon scholarship, but upon a spotless love for
God and a boundless love for man. Herein is
the wisdom of life, and the weakest man or
woman may possess it. All men may not become
learned, but all men may become great
and enthusiastic lovers of their fellow man. The
little child that bends its arms in fervent hugs
to show the measure of its affection; the struggling
youth that stops to help a wounded companion;
the widow, fighting against poverty in
the tenement; the old man, patiently looking
for the coming day—all these may possess the
secret of royal living.</p>

<p>The world will be saved, not by the scholar,
as a scholar, but by the loving heart; not by
platitude, but by kindly deeds. Goodness is
such an easy thing to acquire, that it is within
the reach of all. A little London newsboy was
seen to daily follow an unknown man for many
blocks. When asked by an observer why he did
so he responded, “When he buys a paper from
me, he always smiles, and calls me his boy. He
is the only one who ever called me that, and I
just love to see him.” Here was a life brightened
and perhaps redeemed because a busy man of
wealth took time to say what any one of us is<a href="#Page_95"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;95" id="Page_95"></span></a>
able to say each day. When King Humbert
would have lost his nation he saved it, not by
scholarly exhortations or startling state papers,
but by visiting the hospitals of Naples and
ministering with genuine affection a plague-smitten
people. It was a task of love that the
weakest person might be able to perform, but it
saved a nation for a king.</p>

<p>The world will be saved. Righteousness shall
ultimately prevail. The kingdoms of this world
shall become the kingdom of our Christ. There
are no failures in God’s mighty plans. We may
vary in our beliefs, and differ greatly as to the
process by which he shall accomplish his wise
designs, but this is true: when this world is
brought ultimately to the feet of Christ, it will
have been accomplished not by prayer alone but
by work and prayer, not by the scholar as a
scholar but by the men, learned or unlearned,
who have discovered the compelling and transforming
power of a boundless, undying love.</p>

The Strength of Weakness</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">An</span> old man was once opening the treasury of
his experience to enrich the young people of
Corinth. Youth ever needs such a benefactor,
for life’s most difficult problem is to definitely
determine upon which element or elements of
life the emphasis should be placed. Like a river,
life has so many contributing streams of large
volume that it is difficult to decide unto which
one we are most indebted for our power. There
is only one way to ascertain this fact, and that
is to trace the current of life-power to its source
and stand, with reverent feet, at its utmost
gurgling spring. But this task is hard and is
fraught with danger. What youth, standing at
the joining of the currents, can tell to a certainty
which is the real current and which the contributing
stream of influence? Among the most
pathetic incidents of history are those portraying
some of our richest and most favored sons of
genius mistaking a contributing element of life
for life itself and spending their days within the
narrow winding ways of mediocrity. Youth
needs the open treasury of the past, therefore<a href="#Page_97"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;97" id="Page_97"></span></a>
it is a rare privilege to have Paul thus open the
treasure chest of his varied and triumphant experiences
and tell us what is the secret source
of life’s richest endowment. Looking over a life
of many years, covering an intense and diversified
experience, enriched with mental and
spiritual training, he declared to the young
people of Corinth that the source of personal
power is weakness.</p>

<p>That is the last place in the world that we
would naturally look for strength, for we have
always been taught that weakness is the absence
of strength. To be enduring we believed that
we should possess the rigidity and firmness of the
rocks, forgetful that long after the red stone
walls of Kenilworth have tottered into complete
ruin the fragile ivy, planted by unknown
hands, will still live to cover the rough, broken
heap of weather-beaten stones with the graceful
folds of its swaying branches. We have believed
that stability depended upon rigid strength, not
realizing that, in nature, the strong are the most
fragile, while the weak are the most enduring.</p>

<p>The source of triumphant living is not the
adamantine will that refuses to bend or budge,
but is the will that yields itself to higher power.
Only when one finds that a feeling of weakness is
creeping over him, and realizes that, in his own
strength alone, he is inadequate for the task,<a href="#Page_98"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;98" id="Page_98"></span></a>
does he possess true conquering power. One of
the best hours of a man’s life is when, through
sickness, toil, or persecution, he feels his physical
powers giving way, and his soul rises to claim
the occasion for God and his humanity. Knowing
that while he himself is weak, the needed
power is within easy reach, a man is strong. In
such a crisis, to become self-confident is to be
like the hunted partridge which, seeking escape,
confidently enters the trap set for his destruction.
Strength comes when, overwhelmed with
a sense of unutterable weakness, one flings himself
at the feet of Christ, and prays as did the
sinking disciple, “Lord, save me.”</p>

<p>How very true this is in the hours of our
severe temptation! No man ever sought refuge
from temptation in self-confidence who, in the
strain of battle, did not find his fortress crumbling
into dust, while he himself suffered humiliating
defeat. Simon Peter learned this truth.
Strong and boastful in his self-assertiveness, he
stood amid the gathering shadows of the world’s
darkest and most tragic night, and smiled as one
who gladly greets the dawning of his wedding day.
He was confident, beyond question, that he
was equal to any emergency that might arise.
It was easy for him to boast and proclaim loudly
what he would do. Beholding the same fast-deepening
shadows, Christ fell to his knees in<a href="#Page_99"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;99" id="Page_99"></span></a>
prayer, and with broken voice and heavy, blood-stained
sweat, pleaded for his Father to remove
this cup of suffering. Christ, the everlasting
Conqueror, prays for escape from trial, while
Peter, filled with self-assurance, bids the coming
of the worst with defiant spirit, saying, “Though
all men should forsake the Master, yet will not
I.” He boasted bravely that he was ready to die
for Christ. There was a marked contrast between
the ways these two met the same struggle,
but the whole world knows the outcome. In the
presence of trial Peter’s strength was scattered
like heaps of withered autumn leaves. When he
was strong then was he weak. Without the
passing of the cup Christ walked forth strong
enough to win a world from sin, while Peter sank
in shame. But when, a few hours later, we find
the defeated disciple, all alone, in midnight
darkness, weeping like a little child over his
weakness, we rejoice, for we know now that
Pentecost has found its preacher, and the world
has found a mighty champion for God.</p>

<p>Temptation is a terrible thing. It is a band of
armed brigands, storming the citadel of the soul
to carry away everything that is of value. To
yield is to have the soul ransacked and burned
as though by fire. To face it confidently in one’s
own strength is gravest folly. There is only one
possibility of victory. In that hour of peril,<a href="#Page_100"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;100" id="Page_100"></span></a>
when eternal destinies are at stake, let one feel
his own weakness, and fall helplessly at the feet
of Christ, and call with all the earnestness and
pathos of his frightened soul, “Lord, save, or I
perish!” and victory shall fill his heart with joy
and crown his brow with the light of heaven.</p>

<p>This truth is applicable to all our sorrows.
There have been hours when we thought best to
meet our sorrows and disappointments with the
spirit of a stoic. With clinched fists, tight-pressed
lips, and dry eyes, we stood, proud of
our strength, defying sorrow by bidding it to do
its worst. We insisted that we were not weak
like others, and that we would boldly bear our
own burdens. But the end was defeat and uncontrollable
grief. The burden was so much
heavier and the grief was so much more bitter
than we had ever expected, that we were crushed
and overcome. Meanwhile at our side stood one
frail and weak, whose bloodshot eyes spoke of
countless nights of grief and anxiety, but whose
calm face and steady voice assured us that she
had gained a wonderful victory, and, in spite of
tempest, had inner calm and rest. How came
the victory to the frail? Because she was frail
and knew that she was frail. As headed wheat
saves its life by bowing passively to the stroking
of the violent winds, so she bowed low at the
touch of sorrow. She yielded herself to the will<a href="#Page_101"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;101" id="Page_101"></span></a>
of God. As Mary and Martha, in their hour of
sorrow and puzzling questions, forgot everything
and fell weeping at the feet of their Lord, so this
woman poured out her prayer of utter helplessness
to God, saying, “Save, Lord, or I perish,”
and in her weakness she became strong. The
strength that is needed to meet sorrow comes,
not from self-control, but abandonment to God;
not from dry eyes, but from tears.</p>

<p>How true this is of our ministries to our
brother man! It is not an easy matter for one to
enter the Holy of holies of another’s grief and
sorrow, and minister unto them as a true high
priest. Before the growing work of the church,
as it is beginning to live up to its conceptions of
Christian social service, many of our strongest
Christians are becoming faint of heart; in its
growing work of evangelism they become paralyzed
with fright; because they cannot see how
they can approach and minister to those whom
they do not know. They tremble, not knowing
that their very weakness is their source of
strength. Rash boldness and overconfidence are
not part of the true Christian’s equipment.
With such a spirit no one should dare to enter
the sacred inclosure of another’s grief. It is only
when one refuses to trust in human strength or
wisdom, and, possessed of a spirit of humility,
goes forward in the name of Christ, that he can<a href="#Page_102"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;102" id="Page_102"></span></a>
work successfully for God. You may feel called
upon to do works of charity. If so, go forth in
weakness. Instead of polished speech upon the
lip, let there be a teardrop in the eye. The
hungry soul will understand and rejoice that you
have come. In the hour of some one’s sorrow,
you may be able to give only a tender, silent
handclasp; but be not dismayed. The mourning
one will fully understand and thank God that
he sent you unto him. You may be sent to lead
some sinful soul to Christ. In weakness your
words may fail, leaving you nothing to offer
save a look of love. That is enough. Each sinful
one will understand, and through the light of
your loving look will find a pathway back to
God. Only when we are weak are we strong in
the service of Christ.</p>

Crumbling Palaces</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> crumbling of our palaces does not necessarily
mean loss, especially if they be the grotesque
ones built in untutored childhood, or
those planned in moments of unguarded enthusiasm,
or given form by impractical impulse, or
intended for selfish or sinful pleasure. We have
never tried to live in the blockhouses built upon
the nursery floor, neither do we mold our lives
according to childhood fancies. There can be no
progress without the compelling power of a well-guided
enthusiasm, but overwrought enthusiasm
is an uncontrollable power bringing moral,
physical, and financial disaster. The ability to
yield promptly to righteous impulse is akin to
genius, but the impulses of an untrained soul are
the frenzied switchmen who ditch and wreck the
train that should have the right of way. When
self-interest means the developing of brain and
talents to establish a worthy character and
beneficent influence, making one a constructive
force in the community, it is not to be despised;
but when self-interest becomes selfishness, the
building of a fortified castle in which one lives<a href="#Page_104"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;104" id="Page_104"></span></a>
at the expense of others, then is the soul smitten
with leprosy, and the home becomes a pest-house,
not a palace. A place of sin is never a
shelter, but a death-trap, its elegance of architecture
and furnishings making it all the more
dangerous. There are many palaces unfit for
habitation. To permit them to decay and
crumble into nothingness is greatest gain, for to
live unworthily is not to live at all.</p>

<p>On the other hand there is a neglect that
means a helpless, hopeless poverty from which
no influence or friendship can bring deliverance.
When once these palaces are permitted to
crumble we become homeless outcasts, begging
from a world that begrudges us its crumbs.
Therefore one must consider, not only the beginning,
but the upkeep of life.</p>

<p>There is the palace of Character that needs
guarding. The beginning of the Christian life is
only “the beginning.” Here is the peril of our
present and very popular conception of church
membership. A man often feels that all that is
necessary for his soul’s salvation is to go through
the soulless process of uniting with some religious
organization, and it matters not which one
he may chance to choose. “Joining the church”
is looked upon as taking out a spiritual life insurance,
without any thought of paying premiums
through the passing years. Having his<a href="#Page_105"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;105" id="Page_105"></span></a>
name duly inscribed upon the records of some
church gives a man confidence with which to
face death, and the coming judgment, not realizing
that the Church Record will perish in the
flames of the last day; and that men are judged
by comparing the records which God has kept
with the record that each man writes upon the
pages of his own body, mind, and soul. Preachers
have bigger business at the Judgment than
carrying their Church Records and appearing as
counsel for the members of their flocks. They
must appear at the Judgment and answer for
themselves.</p>

<p>Christian living is righteous living, being
right with God and right with man, in all the
dealings of daily life. It is not, like vaccination,
completed in one short operation, but, like
breathing, an activity that includes every second
of one’s earthly existence. It is not moving into
a furnished apartment which you can secure by
making certain payments, but the building of
the palace of Character. Stone by stone, the
great structure is erected, its foundation resting
upon the solid rock, its walls built with God’s
plumb line, its turrets and battlements lifted
high to receive the blessings of the sky. It is not
built in a day, but requires the unceasing toil of
all our days, else it will crumble into hopeless
ruin.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_106"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;106" id="Page_106"></span></a></p>

<p>Character is not firmly established this side
the grave. There are no character insurance societies.
Right living on the part of youth may
soon give one a reputation of worth, but after
many years of faithful living have resulted in a
palace, admired of men, one misdeed may become
a conflagration that will reduce it to ashes;
one single misspent day may cause the strongest
palace to crumble and decay. The ruins of
Kenilworth are beautiful because covered with
English ivy; for the ruined walls of Character
there is no ivy of sympathy to beautify, but the
bleak and barren wreckage stands in ghastly
hideousness to proclaim to all the world the
story of the misspent day. Both youth and age
alike must guard the palace of Character against
decay.</p>

<p>There is the palace of Benevolence that needs
guarding. In childhood we learned the difference
between the cold hovel of Selfishness and the
great palace of Benevolence, with its windows
ablaze with light to guide our footsteps, and its
hearthstone aglow with welcoming warmth.
How we feared and shunned the selfish soul, not
for the lack of gifts, but because, with the
clear vision of childhood, we beheld the deformity
of his crabbed soul! How we loved the
dweller of the palace, not for his gifts, but for
the beauty of his smile, the soft light of friendship<a href="#Page_107"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;107" id="Page_107"></span></a>
in his eyes, the joy-creating atmosphere in
which he moved. Then and there we decided
to mold our lives after the plans of that good
man, and be benevolent individuals; not spendthrifts,
but possessed of rich, red blood, and
sympathetic hearts ever open to the beauties
and needs of life. But we soon learn that the
palace of Benevolence cannot be built with one
deed of benevolence, no matter how large and
generous it may be. The gift of some great
public institution, however worthy and serviceable
to the people, is not enough to mark a man
as one who dwells in the palace of Benevolence.
That coveted abode is built, not by gift or gifts,
but by the generous spirit with which we daily
and hourly meet the world. Benevolence is not
a gift, nor series of gifts, but the wholesome,
generous spirit which we manifest toward men.
With such a spirit one builds a beautiful palace
in which to dwell, but one that is very easily
marred and destroyed. One selfish desire, once
hardening the heart against another’s need, one
greedy, grasping longing or desire, and the
palace beautiful crumbles into dust; and they
who once rejoiced at our coming will turn away
with the contempt with which all men greet
unworthiness.</p>

<p>There also is the palace of Prayer. No earthly
dwelling is so beautiful as that which one builds<a href="#Page_108"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;108" id="Page_108"></span></a>
for his soul through communion with God.
Always situated upon the lofty heights, above
the lowlands of sin and dusty ways of worldliness,
it lifts its towers and pinnacles into a cloudless
sky. The view is clear and unobstructed, so
that one sees the affairs of life in their true relations
to the great world of which they are a part.
The struggles of their fellow men are in clear
sight and therefore observed with sympathetic,
understanding heart. The sky is close, and
when the sun is set the stars peer through the
shadowy canopy, and smile. The atmosphere is
fresh and pure, made fragrant with the breath of
heaven, and he who breathes it feels a power
divine. Nothing is more beautiful than the
palace of Prayer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the palace may crumble and
become a hopeless heap of dust. Where once
stood a vision of spirituality one can see nothing
but that which is of the earth earthy. A hidden
sin within the heart, that slyly steals away one’s
love for God; a subtle spirit of worldliness, that
deadens the soul until it ceases to respond to
things divine; a gnawing doubt that, like the
white ants of India, honeycomb the timbers of
the bravest, strongest souls—all these cause the
crumbling of the palace.</p>

<p>The palaces of the soul, however well established,
require a watchful eye and careful guarding.<a href="#Page_109"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;109" id="Page_109"></span></a>
The powers of evil are destroying elements
that beat and pound upon the shelters of the
soul with destructive fury. But even then, a
well-built palace need not crumble. He who has
the Carpenter of Nazareth as his daily Companion
may build for eternity. Keeping the
sayings of the Master means that the house is
firmly fixed upon a strong foundation and that
all its timbers are strongly knit together; so that
when the floods come and the winds blow and
beat upon it; when a legion of devils encamp
about and lay siege upon the soul; when fires
sweep, and earthquakes work their devastation
to this planet, these palaces, not made with
hands, and not constructed from earthly material,
the palaces of Character, Benevolence,
and Communion with God, shall not be moved.
They shall shelter us here and be eternal in the
heavens.</p>

The Echo of Life’s Unsung Songs</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">We</span> are familiar with the echo of life’s unfinished
songs. The unfinished songs of confidence,
sung by the martyrs as they stood upon
the yellow sands of the Coliseum, looking upward
beyond the soft blue of the Italian sky to
heights hitherto unseen, have never ceased to
vibrate through the centuries. The unfinished
songs of sacrifice and patriotism which were sung
by our soldiers and sailors who perished in the
world-wide war are still echoing in the music of
every wave that laves the shores of every sea.
We are all familiar with the lingering music of
life’s unfinished songs, but it is well for us to
consider also the echo of the songs that have
never found expression in word or tune.</p>

<p>Each soul is a minstrel whether he wills it or
no, for God has fashioned a harp for every heart.
There is a tradition that above the head of
David’s couch there hung his favorite harp. The
mountain winds coming through the midnight
silence would stir its strings, awaken the sleeping
lover of song, and bid him weave words of
love to fit the wind-wrought music. Thus were<a href="#Page_111"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;111" id="Page_111"></span></a>
the Psalms created. To each individual God has
intrusted a priceless harp, tight drawn with
silver chords of love, and sensitive to every
touch of passing wind and falling sunbeam. So
delicate are these heart-strings that every event
of life awakens the dormant music and fills the
soul with harmonies divine. Behold how sensitive
they are.</p>

<p>The day has been dull and gloomy and you
have not cared to go abroad. After a while you
become reminiscent. As though led by an unseen
hand you enter a quiet, unused room and lift the
lid of a quaint, old-fashioned chest. You know
not why your followed impulses led you there,
but you are glad that you obeyed the leading,
for there, resting quietly amid fragrant lavender,
is a treasured gift that came from a mother’s
hand. It has been lying there for many years,
untouched and unseen, but how beautiful its
faded colors, how lovely its wrinkled folds
placed there by the hands so long since turned
to dust! and how, out of the dim mists of the
past, it brings the soft colors and clear outlines
of a dear, sweet face! There are tears in your
eyes, but more and better than that, there is
music in your soul. Every string of your heart is
vibrant with melody.</p>

<p>One morning you were ill and did not care to
go to the office. You were indisposed just<a href="#Page_112"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;112" id="Page_112"></span></a>
enough to enjoy the rich luxury of being waited
upon, when, suddenly and unexpectedly, your
eyes rested upon an old-fashioned picture that
strangely and wondrously stirred your heart.
For years it had been hanging there with its
treasured memories, but you had been too busy
to notice it. How charming its exquisite beauty
as it greeted you from out its odd, old-styled
frame. Its colors, mellowed with the passing
years, carried you back triumphantly to the sun-bright
days of the long ago, and the soul was
stirred with music that charmed, and soothed,
and inspired.</p>

<p>The harp-strings of the heart are very sensitive.
A finger-print or tear-stain upon the leaves
of the old family Bible, the frail petals of a
faded blossom, the sight of a tiny yellow garment
or baby shoe, a package of letters tied
with ribbon, or a scrap of paper scrawled by unskilled
childish fingers, just little things that no
one else admires or notices, is all that is required
to start the music ringing in our hearts.</p>

<p>To this music the soul always responds with
a song. This is true even when one’s musical
education has been neglected. The ear may not
be able to distinguish one note from another, or
discern the difference between “Old Hundred”
and “The Star-Spangled Banner”; the individual
may know nothing about harmony, time, or<a href="#Page_113"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;113" id="Page_113"></span></a>
measure, when listening to the music that others
have given to the world, but his own soul can
always sing its own melodies. There is no note
so high in the scale that the soul cannot reach it.
I have heard the English lark lift its silver notes
until they melted into sunshine and fell in great
billows of joy upon the listening earth. Every
soul can sing like that. As above the couch of
David hung the harp awaiting the touch of the
passing winds, so each heart is a stringed harp
awaiting the touch of some common event to
awaken music and set the soul to singing its
minstrelsies.</p>

<p>However beautiful these songs, they never
pass the threshold of the lips. Their sweetness
surpasses the power of expression. That must
have been the reason why Mendelssohn wept so
bitterly at times. With all his marvelous power
in weaving tones he could not give expression to
the rapturous melodies which were surging
through his soul. This also explains why
Michael Angelo so often gave way to the
dreariest despondency. Though he try never so
hard, he could not express upon canvas or in
marble form the heavenly symphonies that were
thrilling his soul. The reason that Lord Tennyson
stood for such long periods upon the cliffs,
overlooking the sea, not hearing the call of an
approaching friend, was that his soul was searching<a href="#Page_114"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;114" id="Page_114"></span></a>
through earth and sea and sky, for words
with which to express the songs his soul was
ever singing.</p>

<p>The deepest and most valuable emotions of
life are always inexpressible. How useless is
human speech in the presence of the deep feelings
of awe and reverence! I stood with a friend
upon one of the great heights of the Catskills.
He was a genial man, and the day had been filled
with merriment. Rounding a curve, we came
suddenly to the edge of a great cliff overlooking
the Hudson valley. At our feet were many miles
of forest trees mantling the hills and valleys with
the brilliant coloring of Autumn foliage. We
could count a score of villages nestled peacefully
among the meadows and fields of ripened
grain. The Hudson River rolled its silver length
in the distance, while, far, far beyond us, draped
in blue, we saw the hills and mountains of
another State. Beholding what, in many respects,
was the most soul-entrancing revelation
of nature’s glory I had ever witnessed, neither
of us spoke. The moments slipped by with
slippered feet and the mid-afternoon became
evening, before either of us broke the silence.
It is sacrilegious for one to undertake to express
the holy sentiments of awe and reverence in the
clumsy garb of human speech. This is true of all
deep feeling. Standing in the presence of a<a href="#Page_115"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;115" id="Page_115"></span></a>
bereaved friend, shallow souls can chatter idle
phrases, but deep, healing, tender sympathy is
expressed in the silence of a handclasp and unspoken
word. Looking into the deep, expressive
eyes of one whom we love, our lips are silent and
only the tear-filled eye tells of the song the soul
is singing. Have you ever been able to tell your
mother how much you loved her? The real
songs of the soul are of necessity the unsung
songs.</p>

<p>These songs are the real songs, for the soul life
is the real life. They may never be heard by
others, but you hear them, and their words never
die. They echo through the years. There is
never a moment of thoughtful meditation, never
a season of seclusion; never a period of sickness
when the things of the world are shut out and
one is left alone with the things of the soul;
never a season of disappointment, or sorrow, or
bereavement, or heartache, but that the hour is
made blessed and hallowed with the memory of
these songs, and lo, while one listens, all earth
and heaven become vibrant with music and one
is charmed and soothed with the echo of life’s
unsung songs. While exiled upon the lonely
heights of Patmos John heard a song that
thrilled the heaven of heavens, but none save
the multitude before the throne could learn the
song. That is easily understood. It was not a<a href="#Page_116"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;116" id="Page_116"></span></a>
song blending the varied experiences of earth
together into one mighty outburst of love; it
was the soul weaving all the unsung songs which
no one on earth had ever heard or could ever
understand into one great symphony with which
to praise the God of its salvation. Life’s unsung
songs shall never cease to live in earth and
heaven. Their echoes are our comfort here, our
joy forever.</p>

Modern Judases</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> story of Judas casts a dark shadow
through the sunlight of twenty centuries. His
deed was more than a betrayal of friendship.
Lady Macbeth, coming from the chamber of
death into the candlelight and beholding her
lily-white hands stained ruby red with the blood
of murdered friendship, and fearing to wash
them, lest the ocean’s flood should tell to every
rock-bound coast the blushing secret of her guilt,
was not half so bad as Judas. This deed was
more than the betrayal of friendship; it was the
dark hand of villainy, reaching from behind the
dark curtains of selfishness, that with the keen
blade of greed he might pierce the unprotected
breast of innocence. It was a tragedy that, with
each decade’s growth in love, becomes more
atrocious in the eyes of men.</p>

<p>Named after Judas Maccabæus, one of the
most illustrious characters of Jewish history,
good enough and gifted enough to be chosen as
a disciple, and possessing such integrity of character
that he was chosen treasurer of the group,
Judas began his public career auspiciously. For<a href="#Page_118"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;118" id="Page_118"></span></a>
three years he had been associated with Christ
in the most intimate manner. He had entered
cities and passed through country places,
preaching and performing miracles, until returning
with radiant face he said with the other
disciples, “Even the devils are subject unto us.”
Having been lifted out of his old self, he rejoiced
in the delights of noble living. Within a few
weeks he would have been able to stand
with Peter at Pentecost and take his place
among the world’s beloved immortals. Then
came the awakening. He had followed Christ
through the fragrant fields of the Beatitudes and
under the clear sky of the Sermon on the Mount;
he had seen Christ, at the sacrifice of rest and
comfort, change barren lives into beauty, as the
sun adorns barren branches with clustered fruit;
and now, as his life was approaching the crisis,
Judas could see where the road was leading, and
he became frightened. He saw that the end of
the Christ-journey was not toward worldly
triumph, but toward sorrow, not to a palace,
but a bleak mountainside, not toward a throne,
but a cross; and he began to think of himself.
“What shall I do?” Like one facing a panic he
stood petrified with terror. Seeing the investment
of three long years trembling in the balance,
he did not think it businesslike to follow
Christ any further. His love for money so<a href="#Page_119"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;119" id="Page_119"></span></a>
blinded his eyes that he could not see the moral
grandeur of Christ’s program. Angered and disappointed,
he deserted his post, sought the
seclusion of the night-time shadows to complete
his plans. Well does the inspired writer add,
“And it was night.” Of course it was night;
dark, starless, moonless night, for he had
allowed his love for money to eclipse the Light
of Life.</p>

<p>From then on there was only one light attractive
to Judas, and that was the luring light
of avarice and greed. Seeking for it, he found it.
Like the red fires of hell it burst into flaming
stream from the high priest’s windows, where
Arrogance and Lust for Power were plotting
against the innocent. Rushing toward it, out of
breath, his hands clutching his garments, his
brow wet with perspiration, his eyes staring
madly with greed for gold, he demanded:
“What will you give me?” Shrewd and crafty,
these unscrupulous leaders of men knew that the
language of love and friendship could not be
understood by this grasper of gain; so they used
the only language he could now understand and
wanted to hear—the language of the market
place; and “they promised him money.”</p>

<p>This is one of the darkest pictures in history,
its black shadow reaching through the centuries,
but it does not hang alone in the galleries of<a href="#Page_120"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;120" id="Page_120"></span></a>
death. There are others still making the awful
bargain of Judas, and gladly sacrificing the
innocent for the sake of financial gain.</p>

<p>Behold the unscrupulous real-estate dealers
who force houses of immoral character into
clean, residential sections of cities, betraying the
cause of righteousness, injuring homes, and
damning the souls of hundreds. Because immorality
promises a more handsome and immediate
return for the investment they become
partners in the exploiting of sin and crime. As
Judas went into the quietude of the Mount of
Olives and brought wreck and ruin, so these men
insidiously lead marauding bands of immoral
workers into the best communities, well knowing
that their deed means the betrayal of youth and
maiden, but refusing to give it a thought, their
attention fixed only on the increasing volume of
business. The good name of a city or community,
the value of innocence, and the sanctity
of the home are nothing to these modern
Judases.</p>

<p>Behold the employers of child labor, who,
under the disguise of charitably giving employment
to the poor, are reaping revenues that
provide them with luxuries at the cost of blasted
lives. Many of our shops, stores, and factories
are but presses where the life, hope, vigor, and
vision of childhood are crushed out in order to<a href="#Page_121"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;121" id="Page_121"></span></a>
fill to the brim the intoxicating cup of extravagance
for people whose own lives are too foul
and unfit to be used as grapes in their own
presses. Daily the bright-faced boys and girls,
the hope of the nation, are crowded out of the
public school into the vats. Hour by hour their
lives are pressed out until, broken in body,
dwarfed in intellect, incapacitated for works of
social service, falling far short of the requirements
made upon their later years, they are
thrown aside as useless pomace. The uncontrollable
spirit of greed that places money above
the value of life and happiness and goodness is
the spirit of Judas.</p>

<p>Behold the owners of tenement houses, those
breeding places of filth and sin, where little children
are compelled to live and die, or live and
curse the world. Their only memories of childhood
will be those of the crowded alley, foul
hallways, and darkened corners in which they
hide in fear. The memory of a mother’s face will
be vague, ever hidden in the darkness and gloom
in which she spent her days. Why do they not
have fresh air? Greed. Why do they not have
fresh water to drink? Greed. Why do their
buildings not have good sanitation? Greed.
Modern Judases are they all.</p>

<p>Behold the men who are commercializing
amusements. Men and women need recreation,<a href="#Page_122"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;122" id="Page_122"></span></a>
and children must have places to play. The
human body is not made of harder material than
the locomotive, that requires rest between its
trips, or, growing tired, refuses to carry its load.
Therefore it is necessary to have places of
recreation and exercise. But where shall the
children go? The best bathing beaches of ocean,
lake, and river bank are owned by money-making
syndicates, and the people are compelled
to pay for privileges which are their own by the
right of birth and citizenship. More than this,
since money is the objective, and the people
must patronize their places, having no other
places to go, they offend decency by catering to
the coarse and vulgar element of the community,
thus becoming places of moral contamination
instead of places of recreation. This is also true
of our theaters, moving picture houses, and
amusement parks. That which is presented is
very often so uncouth that modesty must hide
her face.</p>

<p>The deadening influence of the modern
movies, their teachings of sex and treatment of
marriage, is clearly shown in their effect upon
the actors and actresses themselves. They have
enacted these parts so often, and lived in the
atmosphere where these things are discussed as
the predominating tastes of the people, that the
unnatural teachings have become their conceptions<a href="#Page_123"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;123" id="Page_123"></span></a>
of real life until the story of their divorces
and remarriages has scandalized all decent society.
Beside the colonies of moving picture
celebrities, Salt Lake City and other Mormon
strongholds seem quite tame. If the moving
picture has such a demoralizing influence over
the actors and actresses, who are matured men
and women, what will be the effect upon the
growing generations? Already the atmosphere
of school and playground is vitiated. The evil
effects are already manifest to every conscientious
Christian social worker. To silence the
protests of a righteous guarding of the morals of
the young, the moving picture corporations have
set aside large amounts to prevent the needed
legislation regulating censorship.</p>

<p>The work of these modern Judases does not
end here, but they insist upon the prostitution
of the Sabbath day for their ungodly enterprises.
For the sake of making money they are endeavoring
to lead America in the same direction
Europe has been traveling, and to the same
tragic fate. Childhood and the Christian Sabbath
are being desecrated every hour by these
Judases whose one question in life is, “What
will you give me?”</p>

<p>It is time for an aroused citizenship to enter
protest against these evils. We cannot prevent
Judas from having base desires, nor giving his<a href="#Page_124"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;124" id="Page_124"></span></a>
traitorous kiss, but we can compel Pilate, the
officer, to render righteous judgment. Jesus was
crucified, not because Judas kissed him, but
because Pilate was a moral coward. Pilate
washed his hands, declaring himself “innocent,”
but every man in the mob knew that he was
guilty. We cannot prevent Judas betraying, but
we can create public sentiment which will compel
officers to reach protecting hand against the
greed of our modern Judases.</p>

The Adjustable Universe</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">That</span> God should adjust a universe so that all
of its forces and energies should be at the instant
disposal of those who, through obedience to his
laws, lay claim to them, should not seem strange
when we realize how perfectly we are now
adjusting our mechanical and social conditions
to meet the hourly needs of the body. The water
supply of many of our large cities is pumped and
propelled by what is known as the Holly Engine.
Its regulation is perfectly automatic. Without
any apparent cause, there is a constant change
in the amount of steam produced. The engineer
busies himself by oiling the bearings and polishing
the shafts, but seems utterly indifferent to
the pressure of the steam as it relates itself to
the varying demands of the great city. The fact
is that the engineer does not need to concern
himself with the regulating of the engine, for the
people of the city regulate it for themselves.</p>

<p>Whenever a faucet is opened the draft in the
engine is correspondingly opened, the fires burn
brighter, the steam is increased, and the action
of the pumps instantly accelerated. The larger<a href="#Page_126"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;126" id="Page_126"></span></a>
the quantity of water needed, the wider the
drafts, the stronger the fires, the greater the
pressure of steam, the more active the huge
pumps that labor to meet the increased demand.
Quickly close the faucets, stop the outlet of
water entirely, and the pumps will become inactive.
So perfect is this adjustment that the
smallest child, many miles away, may change
the speed of the engine at will. It is designed to
meet the needs of every person in the city,
whether it be but a cup of water to moisten the
fevered lips of a little child or great streams with
which to fight the mighty conflagrations that
threaten the life of the city.</p>

<p>If man, out of common ore which he digs
from the hills, can build machinery to meet the
varying need of his fellow man, should it seem
such an incredible thing that God, who made
the human soul, could, out of his unlimited, unmeasured
spiritual forces, arrange to instantly
meet the need of every human soul? God can
and God does. The fact is that the whole
universe is so arranged. There is not a need of
the soul of man that cannot be immediately
satisfied, if one puts himself in obedient touch
with the fixed spiritual laws that control the
required forces, as, for the thirsty lips, we intelligently
reach out, turn the faucet, and draw the
cup of water.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_127"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;127" id="Page_127"></span></a></p>

<p>It is at this point that the learned individual
who loudly praises himself upon being a practical
observer of life, takes most positive exceptions
and insists that the weakness of the Church
is this very insistence upon what, to him, seems
the miraculous. He has not been able to observe
that the strength of the Church is her belief in
the laws governing prayer, compliance with
which instantly brings all the Infinite resources
of the sky to meet and fully satisfy the needs of
the soul. The fault is not in God’s method of
procedure, but in the narrow prejudices which
the critic mistakes for the laws of logic. Let us
consider the laws governing prayer as revealed
in an old-time incident.</p>

<p>Her eyes red with weeping, and her face
deeply drawn with sorrow, a lonely woman was
pleading with Elisha for help. Out from dark
shadows, she was journeying toward deeper
gloom. She had just buried her husband, on the
morrow she must journey to the auction block
where her two sons, her only means of support,
were to be sold into slavery, to meet the debts
of her dead husband. She was helpless and
heart-broken in her poverty. “What shall I do
for thee? What hast thou in the house?” asked
the solicitous prophet. “Thy handmaiden hath
not anything in the house save”—and she
faltered—“save a pot of ointment.” All her<a href="#Page_128"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;128" id="Page_128"></span></a>
furniture and cooking utensils had been sold to
help meet her financial obligations. There was
only one thing left, and that was the jar of
ointment which every Jewish person kept for
the anointing of the dead. This was never disposed
of. Then came the command, “Borrow
empty vessels, and borrow not a few.”</p>

<p>The two boys were set to work. The novelty
of the situation whetted their curiosity and
ambition and it was not long until the mother
announced that there were enough vessels and
that the doors and windows should be tightly
closed. Then, with trembling fingers, she opened
the little jar and began to empty its contents
into the larger vessels. Three smiling faces bent
over the open mouths of the jars, when, to their
wonderment, the little jar had filled every one
of the larger ones. Now there was no need of
worry. The prayer had been answered. The sale
of the oil would more than meet all the demands
of the creditors. It was wonderful, but natural.</p>

<p>Prayer is answered only according to the law
of continuity. There were more than a
thousand ways in which God could have come
to the relief of the widow. The prophet’s touch
could have filled the empty vessels to overflowing,
as once a prophet’s touch melted granite
rock into crystal streams of water; his touch
could have filled the hut with abounding wealth;<a href="#Page_129"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;129" id="Page_129"></span></a>
common dust might have gleamed as jewels;
unexpected gifts might have been poured forth
as rain; but they did not. God meets the
emergencies of life through the law of continuity.
The way of increase is always yielding what we
have to the workings of higher laws. The small
cruse held the secret of the overflowing jars.
Hunger comes and God asks, “What hast thou?”
and the husbandman answers, “Thy servant
hath not anything save a handful of grain.”
Then comes the command, “Take it to the well-plowed
field, and pour it out.” He does so, and
the field overflows with harvest. For the vine
that man plants God gives the purple clusters;
for the seed he sows God gives a loaf of bread.
Like always produces like, and in prayer is followed
the law of increase. What you have saved
from what you have already owned, determines
the nature of God’s answer to your petitions. If
your heart hungers for sympathy, take the
cruse of sympathy and pour it into the empty
vessel of another’s life. The world yields no
sympathy to the unsympathetic, but never fails
to return with increase each expression of tender
solicitude. If you pray for comforting power to
heal an old wound, take whatever power of comfort
you possess, and begin to minister to hearts
that break. You will find increase that will fill
every empty vessel of your heart, and gladness<a href="#Page_130"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;130" id="Page_130"></span></a>
shall take the place of sorrow. If you are praying
for financial aid, consecrate whatever strength
of brain and muscle you possess to hard, clean
work, and the return will richly recompense you.
If you are asking God to make you of service to
the world, pour out your life into the empty ones
about you, and your petition will be granted.
This is the law of spiritual adjustment. Along
the lines of your own individuality will God prepare
you for the larger task to-morrow.</p>

<p>We must also remember that the increase is
determined, not by divine limitations, but by
our own capacity. The command to the widow
was, “Borrow empty vessels, and borrow <em>not a
few</em>.” God placed no limitations, but, rather,
gave urgent command to plan for large things.
She could have borrowed a thousand empty
vessels and a thousand vessels would have been
filled. Her blessing was determined the moment
she said to the boys who were securing the jars
from the excited neighbors, “That is enough,
you need not borrow more.” That moment she
determined the amount of answer her prayers
would receive. The oil ceased to flow when she
had reached the limit of her preparation. What
a tremendous truth! Our growth and spiritual
attainments are unlimited so far as God is concerned.
The possibility of development is unlimited
so far as this world is concerned, for<a href="#Page_131"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;131" id="Page_131"></span></a>
empty vessels and empty hearts are everywhere.
Our growth is limited only by the breadth of our
sympathies and the scope of our interests.</p>

<p>Borrow empty vessels, and <em>borrow not a few</em>.
What a challenge to the church of the living
God! Begin to think and plan in big terms.
“<em>Not a few.</em>” These are the words of One who
thinks in numbers large enough to include all the
grains of sand in all the oceans and all the stars
of the universe. Count the forest leaves and the
grass-blades and raindrops, and then ask yourself
what God means when he says “<em>not a few</em>.”
May the Christ of social service show the church
of to-day that her power is limited only by her
vision of her opportunity.</p>

Seeing Love</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> value of life is measured by the power of
vision. The savage, tramping the diamond
beneath his feet, and clinging to tooth and claw
of the wild animals he has slain, represents a
very narrow, restricted life, for he possessed a
narrow vision. Beholding fruit-bearing trees, he
saw only the crab and wild cherry of bitter taste.
Looking across the open fields, he saw only the
wind-tossed, tangled grass whose matted meshes
made slow his travel. Along the wayside he saw
only the daisy, and the thorn-mass of the wild
rose bush forming a convenient place in which
to hide while making observations. Because in
the crab he could not see the possibilities of the
Northern Spy, and because in the wild cherry
he could not see the luscious Oxheart, his travel
lacked refreshing fruit. Because in the tangled
grass he could not see the gleaming gold of
ripened grain, he had no food in time of famine.
Because the weedlike daisy did not suggest the
chrysanthemum, and the wild rose foretell the
American Beauty, his pathway was commonplace.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_133"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;133" id="Page_133"></span></a></p>

<p>Following the savage came those of wider
vision, and soon the fields assumed the golden
vesture of the ripened harvests, the hillsides
became rich with luscious fruit, and life’s pathway
was fringed with beauty.</p>

<p>Each individual makes his own universe,
using only, out of the vastness of God’s provision,
such things as he has eyes to see. In the
broad, open, western plains, with far-extending
horizon and translucent sky bedecked with bits
of light to lure the seeing soul to heights heroic,
lives one whose universe is no wider than his
daily task, and whose zenith has never ascended
above his hat-crown. Careless in observation,
his universe is scarcely larger than the dug-out
in which he crawls at night to sleep. Dwelling
in a dark room of the crowded tenement, bound
by the cords of sickness to a sufferer’s bed of
pain, lies one who knows nothing of the majesty
of wind-swept fields, or vastness of the star-lit
sky, but whose careful observations have made
a zenith high enough to overarch the throne of
God, and a horizon wide enough to include
every need of the human soul.</p>

<p>The richness of life depends largely upon how
many of the things of life which ordinary people
call commonplace can be crowded into the
range of vision. The man possessing most of
earth is not necessarily a landowner, but he who,<a href="#Page_134"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;134" id="Page_134"></span></a>
whether rich or poor, learns to observe and
appreciate the things about him. Christ never
owned a foot of land. Standing in the dusty
highway, worn and weary by countless deeds of
sacrificial love, he exclaimed: “The foxes have
holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but
the Son of man has not where to lay his head.”
He was poverty-stricken, yet, in all the history
of the world, never was one so rich as he. For
him every lily held a golden casket filled with
an unmeasured wealth of inspiration. For him
the birds winged their way from heights celestial
to sing their songs of divine forethought. Each
color of the sky was a prophet proclaiming the
things of God. Speaking to his disciples, men
who would necessarily remain poor and homeless,
he said: “Blessed are the meek [those who
are not looking for thrones of authority and
power, but who, in humble state, learn to see the
divine vision], for they own the earth.”</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">I know such an one. A laborer in the field, he
spends his life toiling for the one he loves, living
in a rented cottage, faring on common food,
dressing in coarse-woven garments, and yet
possessing untold wealth. With blistered feet
and sweat-washed brow, I have seen him coming
home, smiling with beaming tenderness, as he
carefully held in his calloused hand the frail,
pink petals of the first spring beauty he had<a href="#Page_135"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;135" id="Page_135"></span></a>
found blooming by his way. He never owned
anything in particular, yet there was nothing in
the universe that he did not possess and enjoy
with rapturous heart. He knows that the voice
of God is heard, not only in the roar of turbulent
cataract, or reverberating peal of the majestic
thunder, but also in the bog and quagmire.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“For in the mud and scum of things,</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s always something, something sings.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p style="margin-top:0">He possesses a wealth that is indestructible.
When one gazes so intently upon a flower that
he beholds it as it really is, he has blessed the
flower with immortality and his soul with an
unfading beauty. The moment he truly beholds
it, God transplants it to his soul, where it can
never die, but live and bloom forever and forever.</p>

<p>Christ came to enrich man’s experience by the
process of extending his range of vision, teaching
him that what meekness does for magnifying
his conception of the natural world, piety does
for the soul’s conception of the spiritual world.
“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall
see God,” and afterwards adding, “God is love.”
As humility gives one possession of the earth,
purity gives one vision to behold the divine
mystery of love.</p>

<p>One of the secrets of Christ’s triumphant place
in history was this vision of purity that enabled<a href="#Page_136"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;136" id="Page_136"></span></a>
him to see the redeeming goodness in the hearts
of the world’s outcasts. Christ could see love,
therefore, when the pious priests were sitting
with folded hands waiting for something to
transpire that was worthy of their attention, he
was busy in city street and country lane seeking
to save that which was lost. He could see love,
therefore when the self-righteous churchman,
through prejudice, was blind to his neighbor’s
need, he was toiling in the service of the loving
heart. Busy men and women could see nothing
in childhood, while Christ, with purity of heart,
could look down upon these little ones, and,
seeing the love that bubbles up in baby hearts to
overflow in kisses, smiles, and laughter, lifted
them to that high throne where value is measured
only in terms of love. The pious ones saw
the raving demoniac standing amid the desolations
of the tombs, and felt that he was too far
gone to help. Looking deep within this poor
man’s heart, Christ saw his innate love for home,
and never stopped until he had brought him into
subjection to his words of power, and sent him,
well and happy, to his home and family.</p>

<p>The zealous religionists saw only evil in the
poor woman who, escaping the rough grasp of
her captors, was crouching at the feet of Christ,
fearful and ashamed to look upward. Looking
into her heart he saw less sin than love—love<a href="#Page_137"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;137" id="Page_137"></span></a>
that was deep, and pure, and changeless, as only
a woman’s love can be; therefore, instead of
killing her because of sin, he forgave her because
she loved, and then bade her go and live the
life triumphant.</p>

<p>Men accustomed to the scenes of crucifixion
were not stirred when one of the crucified
uttered a prayer for pardon. It was a common
occurrence and put down as one of the strange
expressions of loneliness; but to Jesus it was
all important. Looking into the heart of the
dying thief, Christ saw a worth-while love for
that which was good and of finer quality, therefore
he astonished even those who knew him
best by lifting him out of sin and taking him
with him to paradise.</p>

<p>Living triumphantly necessitates one possessing
the vision of purity, without which one cannot
see God. Mother holds the preeminent
place in every life, because her true living has
kept her vision clear, and she sees the good that
lies deep within the hearts of her children. Her
son may become an outcast in the sight of
others. Filled with iniquity, and helpless in the
terrible grasp of passion, he may have lost faith
in himself and says: “There is no hope for me.”
The world hears, and readily agrees, and says
that the young man is hopeless. But not the
mother. To mother there is always hope. Her<a href="#Page_138"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;138" id="Page_138"></span></a>
boy must not be thrown away, for he is of infinite
value. She never notices his sin; she sees
only the soul that lies hidden like a jewel beneath
the rubbish of his transgressions. Seeing
the love within his soul which others could not
see, because they lacked the necessary love to
see, her vision became the power that not only
defies but completely changes public opinion.
Because she loves much, she redeems and saves
him, and compels the community to accept him
as one who has wandered away, but has come
back to the Father’s house. Blessed are the pure
in heart, for unto them is given vision to see
good in every one, and to behold their Lord in
every event of life.</p>

The Dignity of Labor</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">There</span> is no liberty without toil. To enjoy
the freedom of the sunshine, the germinating
seed must lift and throw aside the clod which
outweighs it a thousandfold. Before the blossom
can unwrap its tinted petals in the sunlight
it must, with the warmth of its own healthy
growth, melt the wax that seals it in its winter
sepulcher, and with its increasing strength tear
away the rough bud-scales and hurl them to the
ground. The oriole wings its way and fills the
afternoon with song, only, after earnest effort,
it has liberated itself from the imprisoning shell.</p>

<p>Toil is the golden key which God gave the
human race, that it might find escape from the
self-inflicted slavery of sin. “In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread” was not a curse pronounced
by an offended Deity, but Love’s
whispered secret of escape from harm. Standing
amid the wreck of a sin-torn paradise, man
looked through the open archway of these six
words—“In the sweat of thy face”—and saw
the possibilities of a world-wide Eden. Beholding
the fruit begin to fail, and the greensward<a href="#Page_140"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;140" id="Page_140"></span></a>
become tangled with brush and bramble, Fear
said: “You shall die of hunger.” “In the sweat
of thy face” revealed broad acres filled with
health-giving ripening grain and orchards
laden with luscious fruit. Beholding the lakes
become stagnant, and the river beds becoming
dry and parched, Fear said: “You shall perish
of thirst.” “In the sweat of thy face” revealed
vineyards adrip with purple wine, and desert
lands abloom with beauty because man would
learn to train the mountain streams to follow
where he led. Yea, more, “In the sweat of thy
face” opened a pathway through which Hope
ran to find salvation from the deadly power of
sin. Coming back, with face aglow, that bright
clad Angel bade man first to give his strength
in building an altar on which to offer heartfelt
thanks to God, who had made the human hand
with which to toil and rebuild paradise.</p>

<p>Happy and fortunate is the man who learns
to do his daily stint of work with a cheerful
heart. To him shall be the joy of understanding
that the ordinary duties of life are not burdens
sent to crush him to earth, but blessings through
which he is to work out his own salvation.</p>

<p>Behold how man’s labors have redeemed the
world from barrenness. Soft, yielding swamps
have become hard-paved streets of famous
cities, over which the unappreciative multitudes<a href="#Page_141"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;141" id="Page_141"></span></a>
walk or ride in perfect comfort. Where once the
heated winds blew the drifting sands to-day the
gentle zephyrs fan the rich, green meadows.
Where once the untrained, tangled vines broke
down the struggling tree upon which they clung,
the vineyards yield their purple clusters, and the
orchards give forth their wealth of sweet and
luscious fruit. Where once the wild weeds threw
their choking pollen to the wind, the aster, rose,
and proud chrysanthemum wave upon graceful
stems and toss their pretty petals to and fro.
Where once the savage stretched his tents of
skins, brown-stone mansions lift their open
portals in invitation to the weary sons of toil.
By the sweat of man’s brow, by the toiling
of the multitudes, we are saved from desolation
and made to dwell securely among the
gardens.</p>

<p>Toil saves from sickness. Without the putting
forth of physical effort all men are weaklings.
To be a producer, to change the strength of
brain and muscle into that which is of value to
his fellow man, is not only necessary if he would
play his part in the great social institution of
which he finds himself a part, but it is necessary
for his own mental, physical, and spiritual salvation.
Grinding out his days in unceasing
industry, many a man curses his lot and wishes
earnestly for idleness, not knowing that toil is<a href="#Page_142"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;142" id="Page_142"></span></a>
the making of a man with strong muscles, firm
flesh, large lung capacity, and good digestion,
for toil forces the blood in rapid circulation.
Honest toil is the best tonic. When asked what
was the secret of his good health, a great statesman
responded, “Hard work.” Overfed, full of
gout, and ill humored, a certain man of ease
requested a celebrated physician to prescribe
for him. “Live upon sixpence a day, and earn
it,” was the advice. Over one half of the invalids
of the world could be almost instantly cured, if
they would concentrate their attention, and
direct all their strength, in carrying forward
some worthy enterprise. Caring for a garden is
a good preventive for consumption. Labor
means exercise, exercise means health. Common
toil is God’s prescription by which we are to
work out our salvation from many days of sickness
and depression.</p>

<p>Labor preserves us from needless sorrow.
Imagine the condition of Adam leaving Eden
with all his faculties save that which would
enable him to concentrate his energies upon
some worth-while task—with the power to think
and ponder over the hardships of his fallen
situation; with the marvelous power of memory
to recall his faded days of gladness; with the
power of a good imagination, to paint fairer,
brighter pictures for the future, and yet without<a href="#Page_143"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;143" id="Page_143"></span></a>
the power to organize these faculties for
action, thus having no force of character with
which to achieve. Such life would be worse than
death, no matter what evils death might bring.
But through the gracious promise of the sweat-washed
brow man found surcease for sorrow in
attempting to build a better garden for himself
and little ones. There is no happiness save that
which results in using one’s strength and talents
in honest endeavor. Idleness breeds discontent,
worry, and fear. It adds a thousand pangs to
every grief and sorrow. The most unhappy and
therefore the most unfortunate people in the
world are those who have the financial resources
to sit in idleness and nurse their grief. Better
by far be the poor woman who leaves her dead,
and goes to scrub the floors of a public building,
for in her honest toil she finds a healing, comforting
touch. Toil makes one forget his grief,
soothes him with a gentle hand, and permits the
grace of God to heal the wounded soul and
broken heart.</p>

<p>Labor is a strong tower that shields one from
the onslaughts of temptation. It is the idle hand
that Satan seeks. One half of our incarcerated
criminals owe their position to the fact that they
refused to accept the protecting power of toil to
keep them in the way of righteousness. Having
nothing to do, they fell in with evil companions.<a href="#Page_144"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;144" id="Page_144"></span></a>
Having nothing to do, they partook of questionable
amusements. Having nothing to do,
they followed the evil leading of their passions.
Having nothing to do, sin and disgrace made
them easy captives. One way of salvation is to
escape from temptation, and one of the best
ways to escape temptation is to be so busily
occupied with clean, honest, manly endeavor,
that the devil has no access to the mind with
either spoken word or secret thought. Work out
your salvation from temptation.</p>

<p>Labor may also contribute largely to the developing
of Christian character. There would
be no backsliding in our churches if those who
profess the name of Christ would engage in his
great enterprise of saving and redeeming the
world. The growing spirit of indifference, that
is paralyzing so many of our religious activities,
could not be, had men not become idlers in the
Kingdom. Business men look upon the church
and say that it is weak because it has no program.
This is true. We lacked a program, not
because we had no program, but because we
refused to follow the one that God gave us.
The church is far from being dead. Those
who have kept true to their Divine Lord, and
have humbly, but earnestly worked his works,
have been saved from all these temptations to
sin and worldliness, and their ardor to-day is<a href="#Page_145"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;145" id="Page_145"></span></a>
brighter than on the day they first gave their
hearts to Christ.</p>

<p>Then let us get to work. Labor cannot save
us from the penalty of sin. Nothing save the
grace of God can do that for us, but it can save
us from barren surroundings, from much of our
sickness, from the deadening influences of sorrow,
from the power of many of our most
dangerous temptations, and aid us in spiritual
development. Work with a good will. Let no
man laugh you out of its benefits. Say to the
world, “Yes, I am a laboring man.” Let no
blush come to your cheek, unless it be because
you are not a better and more earnest workman.
Labor with the knowledge that while you are
at your task you are ranked with the mightiest
and most illustrious characters of the world.
Labor adds to dignity. Hard, honest work gives
self-respect. Toil saves one from the life of a
parasite, enabling him to pay his own way, at
the same time leaving the world brighter and
richer because of his toil. The richest jewel that
ever adorned the brow of man is not in the
King’s crown. It is the beaded sweat that
stands upon the tanned forehead of an honest
laborer. Wear it with the dignity with which
a king wears his crown of gold. In the light of
God’s approving smile it will pale and make insignificant
the crown jewels of all the nations.</p>

Above the Commonplace of Sin</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">Individuality</span> is one of God’s ways of expressing
his greatness. His voice penetrates the
centuries like the sound of silver bells, but there
is never an echo. No duplicates are ever found
among the works of God’s creative power. He
gives his gifts unto the world with boundless
generosity, but through the centuries no single
gift has ever found its counterpart. Everything
coming from the hand of God is original, unique,
entirely dissimilar to anything else in the realm
of nature. No two oak leaves are alike. They
may be cut from the same pattern, so that,
no matter where you find them drifting in the
winds, you instantly recognize them, saying,
“These are oak leaves”; yet, of all the millions
of leaves that have unfolded upon branches of
the oaks of countless ages, no two have been
identical in size or form or in the delicate
tracery of the tiny veins which are as delicate as
hoarfrost, yet strong as leaden pipes.</p>

<p>God never duplicates. The wild rose is a
simple flower, possessing but five petals, held
securely in the golden chalice of pollen-laden<a href="#Page_147"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;147" id="Page_147"></span></a>
stamens. Nothing could possibly be more liable
of duplication than this quaint flower of simple
garb, yet of all the wild-rose blooms gathered by
lovers’ hands and pressed to maidens’ lips, of all
the wild-rose blooms that grace the old-fashioned
gardens and trellis the fences of the country
roads with their picturesque, sublime simplicity,
no two are alike. God so respects the pretty
things about which human sentiment revolves
that no two are cast from the same mold. Consider
the blossom that you once kissed, and
pressing, stored away. It is hidden in a secret
place, intended for no eyes save your own, and
viewed only through the clear tears that memory
revives. Guard it with the tenderest care, for
God will never make another blossom just like it.
He respects the tender affections of your heart
that chose this blossom from a lover’s hand
to be the sweetest, fairest blossom of your
life.</p>

<p>When a mother stoops and plucks a blossom
from her baby’s grave, covers it with mingled
tears and kisses, and puts it away between the
leaves of the family Bible, thus binding in one
cover the sweetest sentiments of this world and
the best hopes and aspirations of a better world,
she does a beautiful thing, and our heavenly
Father so honors her love and reverence for her
precious dead that, though a thousand centuries<a href="#Page_148"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;148" id="Page_148"></span></a>
come and go, he will never make another blossom
just like that.</p>

<p>We love all mountains because of their rugged
strength and majesty, yet no two mountains are
alike, for to the mountains God has given
personality. The Rockies stand like naked
giants with knotted muscles ever ready to
grapple with storms that smite their rugged
sides, rejoicing, like strong men, at the ease with
which they break the strength of their adversary,
and hurl the whirlwind, like a helpless
zephyr, into the mighty chasms at their feet.
The Alps are like a procession of kings, bejeweled
and berobed for coronation day. To see
the Alps is to have a holiday and have one’s soul
thrilled with boyhood’s wonderment and praise.
The Catskills are a languid group of charming
country folk with whom you can sit and chat,
and feel the magic wonderment of childhood
creeping through the soul, as you listen to
quaint voices repeat their myths and legends.
No two mountains are alike, for God likes versatility
in heaped-up piles of rock as much as in
fluttering leaves and blooming flowers.</p>

<p>No two sunsets are alike. The hanging tapestries
of the west may be woven in the same
looms of mist, and dyed in the same vats of
scarlet, purple, red, and orange; they may be
laced with the same golden strands of unraveled<a href="#Page_149"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;149" id="Page_149"></span></a>
sunbeams; and their drapery may reveal the
self-same angel touch, yet no two sunsets are
alike, each having its own individuality, and
living forever as a master painting to beautify
the walls of memory. Well do youth and maiden
stand with clasped hands as they face the sunset.
Let them feast upon its gorgeous beauty
until their hearts are filled with light and love,
for they shall never see another sunset just like
that. Returning to the valley’s old familiar
paths, where they shall walk together amid their
mingled lights and shades, they shall rejoice
through many years because of the brilliancy of
that one sunset which God made for them, and
for them alone.</p>

<p>This love for originality is seen in the play of
the wild waves’ crest whose molten silver falls
into beads and necklaces and pendants of unequaled
workmanship to fill the unseen jewel
caskets of the deep.</p>

<p>What is true of the natural world is also true
of man. Consider the variations of the human
face. Reflecting upon the limited number of
features, one is amazed to think that such an
infinite combination of facial forms and expressions
can be created. There are only two eyes,
two ears, one nose and one mouth, and yet
out of that small combination, behold what God
hath wrought! From the soft, pink rosebud of<a href="#Page_150"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;150" id="Page_150"></span></a>
a baby’s smiling face, looking with wistful
wonderment at a newly found world; through
all the charming sweetness of maiden’s cheek
and love-laden eyes; through all the grandeur
of the hero’s chiseled features; through the glory
of motherhood smiling affectionately upon her
little brood; through manhood making battle
for home and righteousness—through all these
until, at last, you behold the unequaled beauty,
majesty, grandeur, and dignity of old age, no
two countenances are alike.</p>

<p>The glory of God is revealed through individuality.
No two persons are alike in form or
feature, gift or grace. No two minds have
exactly the same characteristics. No two souls
look upon life from identical viewpoint, so that
each one varies in his conception of events and
expression of art and letters. A king wears the
crown of his predecessor, but for each brow God
has fashioned the fairer crown of individuality.
Men, as God made them, are not pegs to be
placed in holes, but kings, to sit upon thrones
and rule kingdoms all their own. “Before I
formed thee in the belly I knew thee,” are the
words of Jehovah when he wished to impress
Jeremiah with the infinite care with which he
had been prepared for a noble work.</p>

<p>To endeavor to reshape this divinely appointed
life and mold it after an earthly, man-made<a href="#Page_151"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;151" id="Page_151"></span></a>
pattern is the height of folly, yet this is
the demand of very much of our modern social
life. Society employs a system of repression,
the subduing and crushing of deep emotions, and
substituting a shallow artificiality. It curbs all
naturalness in development and demands a conformity
to certain rigid molds in which every
word, gesture, thought, and impulse must be
cast. Instead of employing the art of expression,
permitting the deep feelings to find normal
outlet, and allowing the salutary unfolding of
individual strength and grace, they check and
curb and repress until the beauty and normalcy
of life is gone. Our present system of society
custom and usages cannot produce great character.</p>

<p>Failing to recognize individuality as the
universal plan, many educators mistake their
function, endeavoring to mold men according to
their conceptions rather than instructing men.
Instead of leading the mind away from the
narrow cloister of tradition, form, and ceremonialism,
into the open air where it can function
normally, and unfold its strength and
beauty in perfect individualism, many intellectual
leaders continue the practice of pitilessly
dwarfing minds and stunting souls.</p>

<p>Sin also leads to the commonplace. Realizing
that man’s strength lies in developing those<a href="#Page_152"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;152" id="Page_152"></span></a>
characteristics that mark personality, the arch
enemy of the soul is ever endeavoring to destroy
them. He tempts to sin, knowing well that there
is no other agency so powerful in destroying
individuality. Sin never lifts men upward toward
lofty heights but always levels downward.
It knows no royalty of character, so it tears
down thrones, casts man’s crown aside, blurs the
eye, palsies the nerve, blotches the countenance,
deadens the brain, hardens the heart, and makes
its victim a member of the common herd. Sin
is not error; it is poison that stunts the growing
aspirations, dwarfs the spiritual nature, lowers
spiritual vitality, and completely destroys all
the royal gifts of God that would distinguish one
in character and achievement.</p>

<p>Therefore righteousness must be preached as
never before. Only through virtue can one lift
himself above the commonplace and his individuality
reach its maximum power. Wrongdoing
destroys while right living makes possible the
complete development of all the noble faculties
of the soul, permitting one to experience the
fullest possible realization of life. Men must not
be repressed by the foolish processes of a misguided
social, educational, or evil custom.
Righteousness must be preached that youth may
know the freedom of goodness and the joy of
righteousness. As birds greet the dawn, by<a href="#Page_153"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;153" id="Page_153"></span></a>
rising on rapturous wing and filling the blue with
exultant song, let youth and maiden greet the
coming day with gladness as they rise above the
commonplace of sin. The Divine plan for their
lives must not be marred by sin or foolishness.
The uniqueness and originality of God’s plan
are the secrets of success. The joys of righteousness
are too valuable to exchange for the misery
and heartache of a wasted life.</p>

The Investment of a Life</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> problem of investment provides much of
the romance as well as the tragedy of life. The
fascination of expending one’s energies or possessions
in legitimate undertakings holds all men
spellbound, whether it be the peasant investing
in seed for the coming harvest, the newsboy
buying his bundle of papers for the evening
trade, or the merchant purchasing wares against
the changing styles and fitful customs. The
investment proving good furnishes the joy and
romance of existence. The investment proving
bad causes the tragedy that shatters the brain,
breaks the heart, smolders the homefires, and
sends multitudes reeling and cursing into the
darkness.</p>

<p>All men are investors. Some of them invest
their brain. Finding that God has honored them
with an intellect capable of development, they
have closely applied themselves to study and
research, until the meanest flower enlarges itself
into an Eden where each petal vein becomes a
winding pathway leading to fountains of nectar
that ever sport and play amid the golden pillars<a href="#Page_155"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;155" id="Page_155"></span></a>
and tapestry of stamen and pollen. They study
until oak trees become mighty ships, iron
fashions itself into sky-scrapers, forked lightning
becomes a servant of the humblest child, sunbeams
become physicians, stars become pilots,
and the sky a playground in which the mind
leaps from world to world and wheeling constellation
to wheeling constellation. Very rich
indeed are the dividends coming to him who
invests his brain against the world’s ignorance
and mysteries.</p>

<p>All men are investors. Some men invest their
bodies. They bend their back to the burden
until the blood vessels stand out upon their
temples like silken nets. They give the strength
of their arms to the hammer and drill until the
flinty cliff becomes broad highways beneath
their feet. They toil until mountains become
winding corridors leading to chests of silver;
valleys bloom with harvests, and frail cocoons
become silken robes. They toil, earning dividends
of daily bread, a happy home, and the
consciousness that the world is better for their
toil.</p>

<p>All men are investors. Æsthetic in temperament,
some invest a love for the beautiful. They
find rhythm in swaying tree branch, harmony in
the moving of winds, music in chirp of crickets,
symphonies in the carol of birds, poetry in<a href="#Page_156"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;156" id="Page_156"></span></a>
gleaming lights upon the water, visions of glory
in the morning and evening sky. They adorn
our cities with temples, fill our homes with immortal
songs, transform white marble into immortal
shapes, and fill our galleries with visions
of sunsets that never fade, trees whose leaves are
never driven by the November winds, children
who never grow up, and family circles unbroken
by death. Dividends surpassing belief belong
to these true and faithful lovers of the beautiful.</p>

<p>All men are investors. Some men invest their
gift for business. They concentrate their
energies on the art of trade until gigantic ships
cut the ocean waves, steel rails join nations and
continents, wire threads bind home to home,
keeping each ear within instant reach of loved
one’s voice, refrigerator cars that bring the fruit
of the tropics to the Christmas table, and means
of transportation that finds a world-wide sale
for the handiwork of the humblest toiler. All
honor to such men! Nations do not coin currency
for business. Business is the mint whose
products fill the coffers of the nations.</p>

<p>All men are investors. Some invest their
heart’s affections upon things divine. Their ears
are closed to evil and they know not concerning
things that blight and blast, scorch and consume
the soul. Their eyes are closed to the
suggestive, therefore evil finds no lighted pathway<a href="#Page_157"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;157" id="Page_157"></span></a>
to their imagination. Their hands are held
firmly and will not touch that which contaminates.
Their lives are like unto that of the
Lord Jesus, and therefore they are the children
of freedom. Their words drop like the dew, each
crystal drop reflecting the heavens toward which
they journey. Their smiles are like unto sunbeams
upon harvest fields, making the grain
sweeter of kernel and more golden of husk.
Their voices melt with tenderness as ripe
grapes drip wine. Their opinions are permeated
with charity as ripe fruit is filled with fragrance.
Their coming is like that of a messenger from a
friendly king.</p>

<p>Each man is an investor, whether he invests
his intellect for education, his body for physical
betterment, his æsthetic nature for art, his business
sagacity for prosperity, his heart for the
fellowship of God, receiving benefits and meeting
his honest obligations to the world. Honesty
demands that each individual should be such an
investor, investing himself and all that he
possesses, for he who refuses to do so robs his
fellow man. For such hell is a moral necessity.
He who refuses to yield himself to the plan of
God must not be disappointed when he finds
himself outside of God’s plan for his happiness
and welfare.</p>

<p>There are no safety deposit vaults for God’s<a href="#Page_158"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;158" id="Page_158"></span></a>
gifts to man. When times of financial panic
come, frightened and panic-smitten men withdraw
their currency from circulation, store it
away in a vault, thus hastening the national
disaster. Panics come when men refuse to
invest. In an hour like the present, when moral
forces are facing a panic, when organized forces
for evil are using every possible unprincipled
means and method to press righteousness to the
wall, no man has any right whatever to withdraw
and hide his talent. Every lover of truth,
every believer in immortality, should give the
best he has, every faculty and talent, the widest
possible circulation. Invest, and invest heavily,
is the order from on high. Invest in order to
restore confidence to the people of God. Let
them feel encouragement by seeing that the very
best you have is at the disposal of all mankind.
Refusing to do so makes one a miser deserving
of nothing save the curse of man. Upon the
wholeness of the investment depends one’s
destiny on the Day of Judgment. To the one
who, by investment, has increased his talent,
God says: “Well done, good and faithful
servant, enter into joy.” To the one who refuses
to make investment of his life, he says: “Take
away that which he hath.” The Judgment
hinges on the problem of investment.</p>

<p>That we make not fatal mistake let us remember<a href="#Page_159"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;159" id="Page_159"></span></a>
that no talent is properly invested unless
done so with a reverent purpose. Talents may
be invested aimlessly and without results. To
bring paying dividends the investment must be
backed by a life having a noble purpose. To
illustrate, if you were compelled to sum up your
entire life in one sentence, what would you be
able to say of yourself? What one predominant
characteristic do you recognize as being the
index of your life? You reply, “I am a student.”
Is that all you can say? You have invested
brains, are an educated man, but is that all?</p>

<p>Unless you have applied your intellect to
successfully solving some problem for those who,
denied your blessings, are ignorant and superstitious,
your knowledge is valueless and will be
buried with you. You may be a toiler, but unless
you have tugged away and lifted, with all your
might, at the world’s burdens, your strength will
go with you to the grave. If your investment of
the æsthetic does not make the world more
beautiful, it is valueless. Are you successful in
business? Is that all that can be said? You
may be worth many millions of dollars, but if
your gold has never gleamed in true philanthropy
it will crumble into dust with your body.
You may be good, but unless your goodness
expresses itself in sacrificial service, it is worthless.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_160"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;160" id="Page_160"></span></a></p>

<p>That which is enduring demands, not the
investment of talents alone, but the investment
of the whole life. To give your talents indifferently
marks you, not as an investor, but as a
spender, and anyone can spend money, especially
inherited money. To make an investment
demands a whole life centered upon one holy
and noble purpose, for which one spares neither
toil nor sacrifice, energy nor time, until the
united efforts become permanent in the world
and forever identify your name with that noble
purpose. To invest wisely is to endow one’s
name until it stands out the rich embodiment of
some worthy purpose, as the name “Dante”
stands for poetry, the name “Abraham Lincoln”
stands for the emancipation of the slaves, the
name “Garibaldi” stands for liberty, the names
of Peabody and Shaftesbury stand for benevolence,
and the names of Wesley and Moody
stand for the redemption of a world.</p>

Thought Planting</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">There</span> is nothing more common, and seemingly
insignificant, than the planting of a garden.
There are the simple upturning of the sod, the
mellowing of the soil, and the burial of a hard-shelled
seed. Let a chemist analyze the soil, and
a scientist examine the seed, and they will be
unable to find anything signifying relationship
between the two. There is nothing, so far as the
human eye can see, to suggest that the combination
of seed and soil would be other than the
combination of stone and stubble. But when
once planted all the universe knows about the
little brown seed. The earth and the seed were
made for each other, and no sooner do they
come in proper contact than the whole universe
is set in motion about and for the development
of that buried germ. There is not a cloud floating
afar nor a star gleaming mildly in the distant
blue that does not exist for that tiny seed until,
through the ministration of sunbeam and moonlight,
shower and baptismal dew, the seed arises,
clothed in the glory of a resurrection, to lift
itself in right royal grandeur above the clod.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_162"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;162" id="Page_162"></span></a></p>

<p>No one can explain how the inanimate can
thus become living tissue, but the sun keeps
warming its leaves with caresses, and the kindly
winds bring tribute from distant lands; and the
guarding stars keep sending their benign forces,
and the cool hand of the darkness offers its
chalice of dew, so that the seed becomes a tree,
whose nectar attracts the bees and butterflies,
and whose wide-extending branches become the
home and playground of the birds.</p>

<p>There is nothing seemingly more insignificant
than the planting of a garden unless it be the
beginning of a good and useful life. It is simply
planting a thought in an ordinary human brain.
The wise philosopher may examine the thought
and pronounce it quite commonplace; the grammarian
may test it and say that it could be
constructed in a more exact and polished
manner; the physiologist may examine the brain
and pronounce the texture of its convolutions as
being most ordinary. There is nothing anywhere
to indicate that the combination of that particular
thought and that particular brain could
result in anything particularly extraordinary.
The possessor of the brain may feel no different
after the planting of the thought and have no
presentiment of what it shall mean to him in the
years that follow. But the whole universe knows
about the thought planting. As the stars remember<a href="#Page_163"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;163" id="Page_163"></span></a>
the buried seed, so all the divine forces of
earth and heaven are set to work about the
planted thought. Days and weeks may pass
without the world observing any appreciable
results, and it may even forget the planting.
But God has not forgotten. He is remembering
it, guarding it with divine care, and the results
will appear sooner than we think.</p>

<p>That is the reason, I believe, that Christ took
the mustard seed for the foundation of a parable.
The seed is not only one of the smallest, being so
little that it can slip unnoticed from your grasp,
and hide within the crevice of a clod, mocking
your solicitous search, but it is of most rapid
growth. Within a fortnight it will overshadow
the garden, and before the season is ended will
tower twelve to fifteen feet in height, its sturdy
branches affording shelter, and protected nests,
for many birds. Divine thoughts within the
brain are capable of this marvelous development.
The planting may be an unattractive
thing to do; the mind itself may be as unresponsive
as the soil at the first planting of the
seed, but God has not forgotten his truth, and
all the universe is working for its fullest development.
Soon, very soon, will it manifest its
marvelous nature by rapid growth and bloom.</p>

<p>Here is a little lass, living among the forests of
Domremy. Day by day she watches the soldiers<a href="#Page_164"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;164" id="Page_164"></span></a>
of hostile powers tramping along the dusty
highways to devastate the land she loves so
dearly. Her heart aches as she sees her people
languishing helplessly under the heavy yoke of
oppression. Standing with tear-filled eyes one
day she hears an old man say: “God will one
day raise a deliverer for the French.” Amid the
dust arising from the tramping of an invading
army a thought was planted in the mind of a
child.</p>

<p>Here is a little girl at Ledbury, near the
Malvern Hills, sitting in her father’s dooryard,
looking at the mysterious letters of a Greek
book, whose secrets refuse to yield themselves
to her inquisitive brain. Disappointed, she
buries her face in her book and weeps, only to
be found by a kind friend who picks her up and
whispers in her ear: “There, do not cry. A little
girl can learn Greek if she tries.” The world
goes along as usual, not knowing that a new
thought has been planted, and that girls may
learn Greek as readily as do the boys.</p>

<p>Here is a little boy, standing by a harpsichord,
watching his father’s fingers find the notes upon
the ivory keyboard. His soul is filled with
delight as he listens to the melodies that arise.
Beholding the nervous twitch of the tiny fingers
longing to earnestly and reverently touch the
music-making keys, the father bends low,<a href="#Page_165"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;165" id="Page_165"></span></a>
and says: “Be patient, son, and keep loving
your music, for some day you will be a great
musician.”</p>

<p>Here is a little boy drawing with charcoal
upon the white walls of his mother’s kitchen,
while a precious old grandmother sits watching
the young artist. Taking him in her arms, she
said, “Do not paint to rub out, paint for
eternity.” Commonplace words uttered in a
commonplace home by a very commonplace old
lady.</p>

<p>Here is a bright-eyed little boy kneeling at his
mother’s side to say his prayers. Having finished
his petitions, the Christian mother says, encouragingly,
as she strokes his head, “Only be
good, my precious boy, and God will use you to
help the thousands.”</p>

<p>We have seen these five persons putting
ordinary thoughts in what seem to be ordinary
brains. These five children felt no enraptured
thrill, the ones who sowed the thoughts did not
remember the day. But all the universe of
spiritual power knew about the planting, and
consequently the seeds grew. Watch the little
girl among the forests of Domremy, leaning
against the trees, buried in thought, and listening
to the voices that ever speak of redeeming
France. Watch the little girl bending over her
Greek book, day after day, finding the key that<a href="#Page_166"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;166" id="Page_166"></span></a>
unlocks the beauty of Homer and Thucydides.
Watch the little lad sitting past the midnight
hour, his long curls falling in rich folds about
his face as he bends over the harpsichord
awakening the slumbering strings. Watch the
little lad gathering clays of various colors and
grinding them into paint, which shall, at the
touch of his brush, awaken angels upon the
canvas. Watch the little lad who learned to
pray at his mother’s knee, gathering the
students of Oxford about him to spend the
evening hour in prayer. God has not forgotten
the good thoughts sown in the days gone by, and
all the spiritual forces of the heavens are working
for their most complete development. Soon
the little lass of Domremy, obedient to the call
of the voices, mounts her charger and compels
King Charles, the invader, to flee and give back
the government of France to her people. Soon
the little girl who studied so diligently to learn
Greek will become Mrs. Elizabeth Browning, to
make the centuries happy with the music of her
poems. Soon the little lad at the harpsichord
will become the mighty Mozart, whose music
lingers like the sweet fragrance of dew-wet
flowers. Soon will the little boy, drawing with
charcoal, begin to paint for eternity, and the
“Angelus” and “The Man with a Hoe” begin
their deathless career, as a tribute to toil, and<a href="#Page_167"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;167" id="Page_167"></span></a>
an eternal protest against oppression. Soon the
boy of Epworth and the youth of Oxford will
become John Wesley, the leader of the great
revival which swept England at a critical period
and directed her on the right track.</p>

<p>No one can understand the mystery of the
growing seed, or the greater mystery of the
growing thought, but each individual can have
such a love for childhood and its future that he
will guard with jealous care each word that
leaves his lip, determined that in the sowing
nothing but good seed shall find lodgment in
any heart. An evil thought planted in a child’s
mind grows into a ruined life and blasted
character. Let not even the idle word be an evil
one for fear of the harvest. What an incentive to
become good husbandmen planting righteous
thoughts in the minds of childhood, looking
forward to harvests that shall never end!</p>

The Rosary of Tears</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">God</span> meant man to be happy. The sweetest
music of this world is clear, ringing laughter.
Beside its resonance the majestic voice of the
cataract, the rolling melody of dashing billows,
the gurgling ripple of the sun-kissed streams, the
thrilling throb of the wild bird’s song, the merry
chirp of the cheerful cricket, the lyric of the
wind-tossed leaves are as nothing. Better one
sudden, spontaneous outburst of childish
laughter than all the symphonies and oratorios
of the long centuries. Nothing can equal it. It
comes with the spontaneity of a geyser, rolls
out upon the atmosphere like a volley of salutes,
thrills like martial music, its quick vibrations
making the sunbeams tinkle like silver bells.
It is contagious, causing the facial muscles of our
friends to relax and begin to run and leap into
the radiant smiles, their vocal cords to
burst into song, and the whole world becomes a
better and happier place for all mankind.</p>

<p>As the sunshine makes battle with shadows,
so men and women should wage warfare with
everything that depresses. Children have a right<a href="#Page_169"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;169" id="Page_169"></span></a>
to laugh, and youth has a right to rejoice in the
morning light of life that floods the pathway
with the bright and brilliant colorings of hope.
We must not be too exacting with others,
neither must we endeavor to abnormally repress
our own feelings. There is a restraint that is
not culture and a self-control that is not temperance.
Some people would be far more honest
in their dealings, and have better rating in their
own community, if they did not exercise such
an exacting self-control over their deep feelings
of honesty, justice, and brotherly love. There is
a boundless strength in emotion, therefore
laughter and happiness are absolutely essential.
Let happy hours be golden beads, which, strung
upon the silken cord of memory, will become a
rosary with which to count our prayers.</p>

<p>Laughter is essential, because of its relationship
to tears. In the truest sense pure tears and
pure laughter are one. It requires a raindrop to
reveal the hidden beauties of the sunbeam. Beholding
the rainbow spreading its many-colored
folds over the dark shoulders of the storm cloud,
we utter exclamations of gladsome surprise.
How marvelously beautiful it is! But every sunbeam
would be a rainbow if only it had its
raindrop through which to pass. It requires
vapor to reveal the hidden depths and treasures
of the sunbeam. Tears are to laughter what<a href="#Page_170"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;170" id="Page_170"></span></a>
raindrops are to sunshine. They reveal the
deeper meaning of our joys. Without them we
should never appreciate or understand the
brighter moments. When we count each hour
of happiness as a golden bead, we must consider
each teardrop as a crystal or polished diamond,
to gleam upon the rosary of the heart.</p>

<p>Sincerely pity the man who has lost the art
of shedding tears, for he has, through self-control,
restricted his emotions, so as to exclude
life’s best experiences. Without a tear-moistened
eye one cannot clearly comprehend the brightness
of the sky, the majesty of the sea, the
commanding splendor of the mountains, or the
wealth of gold that lies buried in every human
heart. Without tears one can never experience
the rapturous joy of truest love or holiest
patriotism. The greatness of the soul is measured
by the depth of its emotions, and the extent
of influence is determined by the readiness with
which one permits the deep emotions to shed
their glory.</p>

<p>Herein is hidden a secret of triumphant power.
The greatest victories are won, not by gun and
cannon, but by deep emotions expressed in tear-dimmed
eyes. Great achievements are wrought
by men who can feel keenly and deeply. Behold
Garibaldi conquering a great Italian city. A
thousand soldiers, armed with rifles, and supported<a href="#Page_171"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;171" id="Page_171"></span></a>
with heavy artillery, stood ready to
oppose him. Commanding generals, with drawn
swords, stood ready to give command to fire the
moment he made his appearance. This was the
day that he had announced that he would take
the city. Hours passed and neither he nor his
army came in sight. Finally, in the afternoon,
amid a cloud of dust, a carriage is seen rapidly
nearing the city. Every eye is strained to see
its passenger, when lo, above the dust, rises the
stalwart form of the great Italian. Without gun,
sword, or protecting soldier, the great general
who has come to take the city, is standing erect
in an open carriage, his arms folded in peace.
Each defending soldier is ready to obey command,
but no command is given. In the presence
of such remarkable courage each officer is
motionless and speechless. No moment of
Italian history was more tense. Suddenly some
sympathizer shouted, “Viva la Garibaldi!” and
in an instant every weapon is dropped and
Garibaldi takes the city and holds it as his own.
The power to advance in the face of great odds,
with no weapon save a burning heart and tear-filled
eyes, has wrought more victories than
we know.</p>

<p>To cry is not weakness, for tears are evidences
of strong character. We have always loved
Mark Twain, enjoying his travels as much as he,<a href="#Page_172"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;172" id="Page_172"></span></a>
and laughing away dreary hours with his
bubbling humor. But humor never revealed the
true man he really was. It was not until his
daughter died, and he sat all alone at home on
Christmas day, amid the unopened gifts, and
broken hopes of life, and wrote the matchless
story of her death, that the world caught glimpse
of the real Mark Twain. Beholding her lying
there so quietly, he said: “Would I call her back
to life if I could do it? I would not. If a word
would do, I would beg for strength to withhold
the word. And I would have the strength; I am
sure of it. In her loss I am almost bankrupt, and
my life is a bitterness, but I am content; for she
has been enriched with the most precious of all
gifts—that gift which makes all other gifts
mean and poor—death.” It required the teardrop
to reveal the real character of Mark Twain.</p>

<p>While for our friends we would have nothing
but golden hours, for ourselves the rosary of
tears is the most precious treasure we possess.
None other creates such a spirit of devotion,
none other so thoroughly prepares us for conquest;
none other opens the heart to those
diviner emotions which should thrill the inner
life of all. The golden beads will become tiresome,
but the crystal rosary of tears will always
be attractive. Count over its beads. There are
the large, fast-falling tears of childhood. Tell<a href="#Page_173"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;173" id="Page_173"></span></a>
them one by one, and behold how they bring
back the holy memories and yearnings for childhood
purity and childhood faith. Hold fast
those blessed beads that were once kissed away
by a mother’s lips, but still sparkle in the light
of her precious love. There too are the glittering
tears of youthful ambitions, when the heart
burned with passion, the brain whirled with plans
for conquest, and the eyes were moist with tears
of hope. How precious those tears that have
long since ceased to flow! But they are not lost.
We still have them on our rosary when we offer
prayer, and the touching of them revives our old-time
hopes. There also are the tears of love.
The busy, all-consuming fires of worldly ambition
cannot dry them away. They gleam in the
eye every time memory presents the portrait of
that precious face. How wonderful to love
until the eyes blind with tears of ecstasy!</p>

<p>There too are the priceless tears of sympathy.
The sight of another’s wrong or sorrow unloosed
the fountains of the deep, and your heart responded.
In order to right the wrong you gave
yourself to work of reform, and made your
influence a powerful factor in the remaking of
the world. There, gleaming more beautiful than
all, are the tears of sorrow. They were shed at
the side of the grave; they came into the eye at
the sight of an empty chair. How unbearable<a href="#Page_174"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;174" id="Page_174"></span></a>
the world until relief came in a flood of tears!
Only through tears do we find the sweetest
comfort.</p>

<p>Thus, our devotions become more helpful
when we hold this rosary of priceless treasure.
These beads can be purchased of no merchant;
they cannot be blessed by any priest. They were
wrought in the fires of our suffering, and, because
we trusted him, they were blessed of God.
They cannot heal the soul—only God can do
that; but they help heal the soul by quickening
our memories and reviving our past experiences.
Let no one rob you of the beneficent influences
of deep feelings, whether of joy or sorrow, for we
are never so much in the spirit of prayer as when
we hold in our hands the rosary of tears.</p>

The Hearthstone of the Heart</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">Speaking</span> to a young man who was about to
assume the more weighty responsibilities of religious
work and living, Paul bade him stir up
the coals of genius, and build a fire of enthusiasm
that would warm and set aglow with holy zeal
his every endeavor. “I put thee in remembrance
that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in
thee.” As the housewife stirs the living coals
out of the dead ashes of the old fireplace, and
fans them until they glow with sparkling fervor,
setting aflame the newly placed faggots, making
the room radiant with good cheer as shadows
dance along the walls and ice melts from the
frost-screened windowpanes, so out of the dead
ashes of past enthusiasm he was to stir up the
living coals of his best gifts until they snapped,
and sparkled, and burst aflame, filling the heart
with brightness, and creating an atmosphere
that would melt the ices of indifference from the
windows of his soul, and give him a clear vision
of a great wide world. Yea, as in the days of
Paul, one would take a dying torch, and placing
it to his lips, pour out his breath upon it until<a href="#Page_176"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;176" id="Page_176"></span></a>
it burst in flame, that he might have a torch of
burning fire to guide his footsteps through the
darkness of the starless midnight or to flash a
message to the people living upon the distant
hilltop, or to kindle the fireplace wood until the
cold corners of the house breathed a hearty
welcome to the tired and frozen travelers, so the
young man was to take the divine elements of
the soul, breathe upon them the breath of prayer
and devotion, until they blazed and burned and
cast abroad their helpful influence.</p>

<p>Within each human heart, however covered
with the smothering ashes of sin, are God-made
sparks of celestial fire that long to rise on wings
of flame and make heroic battle with oppressive
darkness. There are too many lives which,
through carelessness, never burn bright, but,
like smoldering flax, slowly eat themselves away,
darkening and corrupting the very air they
should illumine. When they began the Christian
life they were radiant with hope, beaming
with enthusiasm, and flashing with chivalric
courage; but the spirit of worldliness choked
and smothered them, until now, like the dead
hearthstone of some shell-torn house upon the
battle line, they offer to a worn-out world no
hope of hospitality. To guard against this
choking of the soul, this smoldering of genius,
this reckless burning out of the priceless gifts of<a href="#Page_177"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;177" id="Page_177"></span></a>
God, Paul urges all young men to stir up these
coals and fan them into radiant and glowing
character.</p>

<p>It is not the will of God that any life be
formal and indifferent. How much all forms of
life, plant, and animal owe to the hidden fires
within the bosom of the planet, no scientist has
been bold enough to state; but this we know
about mankind, without the inner fires of burning
thought and all-consuming zeal there is no
productivity. And no life need be cold-hearted.
For the hearthstone of every heart there are
three divine qualities that should burn with all
the intensity and fervor as in the hearts of
ancient seer and prophet.</p>

<p>There is the quality of Faith that makes God
real. To many people God seems so far away
that it is an impossibility for him to be a very
important factor in their daily lives. He is a
sort of good-natured Generality, to whom they
may address petitions of greater or less degree
of piety, without fear of being embarrassed
by an answer. Should it be announced with
certainty that at a given time the accumulated
prayers of a twelvemonth would be
answered, fifty per cent of the people would be
afraid to face the hour. Some have prayed for
purity of heart, but if there is anything in the
world that they do not want, it is purity of<a href="#Page_178"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;178" id="Page_178"></span></a>
heart. Nothing would be more embarrassing to
carry into their haunts of enjoyment and more
difficult to explain to their companions. Others
have prayed for God to accept them as living
sacrifices, yet sainthood, to them, is as shocking
as yellow fever. I once knew a man who prayed
“Let justice rule supreme.” It is a pleasing
phrase and a consummation to be devoutly
wished for, but had it been answered in this
particular case, the man who uttered the prayer
would have gone to the penitentiary. Few
people deny the existence of a God, but many
live as though there were no God. But these are
not the real lives. The men who really live and
give a homelike feeling to the world are those
who have stirred up the embers of their faith
until they burn with an all-consuming warmth
that makes God a guest of honor. To such souls
God is marvelously real, and they rejoice to
have him dwell within. When faith once lays
hold on the Almighty no other experience is half
so real. One needs read about it in no book,
consult no priest or preacher, nor plead with
friend to lend the information, for he knows it
for himself. Sitting beside the hearthstone of a
living, flaming faith, our hands feeling the
pressure of that mighty Hand that never harms
but always serves, our souls rejoice with unmeasured
joy to realize that we are in the<a href="#Page_179"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;179" id="Page_179"></span></a>
presence of God who knows and understands,
and who not only walks the weary ways with
us, but gladly dwells within.</p>

<p>There is the quality of hope that makes
heaven real. So long as hope burns within the
heart there is no fear of winter winds, but when
hope dies the soul dies. How gladly may old
age look over the world in which it spent the
four-seasoned life of toil! Here is the spring of
life where the daisies grew and the cowslips
scattered gold about the feet. Yonder the
harvest fields of manhood’s power in which a
bared arm of strength gathered the treasures of
the soil while right merry thoughts centered
upon a nearby cottage toward which he knelt
each time he tied a band of gold about the
garnered sheaf. Yonder the carefully planted
violets grow upon a tiny mound, bright children
of the sun making battle with the cold shadows
of a marble slab. Now the autumn time of life
fades into wintry quiet. The song of the brook
is hushed beneath ever-thickening ice, the trees
are robbed of color, the fields are trackless wastes
of snow. The four seasons of life are growing
to a close, the last afternoon is coming to its
twilight, and yet one is not sad. The fires of
hope still burn upon the hearthstone of the
heart, and fill the soul with the light of its immortal
home. Heaven is not a far-away land,<a href="#Page_180"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;180" id="Page_180"></span></a>
vague with mystery, and dim with distance, but
a place that is real and very close. We breathe
its scented air, and bathe in its golden light
while hope is burning divinely bright within our
hearts.</p>

<p>The hope of heaven does more than offer us
compensation for the wrongs of life; it gives
man an intelligent interpretation of the things
of time. Until one believes his citizenship is in
heaven he cannot intelligently perform his daily
task. The painting that lacks perspective is a
daub; the hopeless life is dismal failure. Therefore,
as one prizes the best, he should stir up the
gift of hope until heaven is as real as home.</p>

<p>There is the quality of love that makes the
world seem real. At the fireside of a loving
heart, one readily learns the true secrets of the
world in which he dwells. There is nothing so
potent as love to give vision to the soul, clearness
to the eye, effective service to the hand.
Then stir up the gifts of love. Build in your
heart the fires of a quenchless affection that
refuses to believe the worst, that will never give
consent that anyone has gone too far in sin for
reclamation, but ever believes that one more
touch of kindness will bring the person back to
God; a love that gladly sacrifices everything of
value in his effort to redeem that which has no
value; a love that knows no selfish interest and<a href="#Page_181"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;181" id="Page_181"></span></a>
daily seeks the welfare of another. Then will
the world cease to be hazy and fantastic, but
will be as real as the ones of your own household,
who gather each evening hour about your fireside.</p>

<p>Let not your love for one single individual die;
it robs you of too great a joy. Warm up your
hearts by allowing the fires of faith in God, hope
of heaven, and love for all men to blaze and
burn in high, exultant flames that know not
how to die. Without it your life will be as
barren as the deserted house through which the
winter winds pass undisturbed. Make your life
homelike by keeping bright the hearthstone of
the heart.</p>

The Unoared Sea</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="first-word">Each</span> one spends his childhood playing upon
the golden sands of an unoared sea, over which
in the after years he must find his way to shipwreck
or safe harbor.</p>

<p>How little does childhood in its helplessness
know of life! Pleased with simple things, it
greets the world with gladness, and shouts for
very joy when finding a tinted shell or bit of
seaweed. With spades of tin it undertakes to
dig a hole “clear through the earth,” and smiles
in contemplation of a vision of the Chinese sky.
With chains of sand it undertakes to bind the
rushing waters of the tide which granite cliff and
flinty rock cannot subdue. The child undertakes
great things while he himself is not strong
enough to withstand the smallest wave, but,
leaving his unfinished task, runs homeward at
the coming of the tide. The waves roar with
laughter and the spray sparkles with merriment
as they destroy the feeble efforts of his puny
hands. Childhood knows little of the unoared
sea of life whose marvelous power of wave and<a href="#Page_183"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;183" id="Page_183"></span></a>
tide threatens to destroy all the childish and
manly efforts of his life.</p>

<p>The desires of the sea may be fulfilled. With
youthful enthusiasm and unguarded courage he
may make fatal venture and be lost. There are
many such of wholesome soul and worthy purpose
whose most cherished hopes and plans
came to shipwreck and disaster. The seas of life
are strewn with wreckage. Yet one must not
be pessimistic and forget that the raging sea is
not omnipotent. With all its wild dashing
waves and boisterous winds it is not as strong
as that little lad may become. The weakest
child may yet be able to dig a pit large and deep
enough to bury all the swollen waves; and
build a cable of sand strong enough to bind
securely the rising and the falling tides. Some
day, over the calm and quiet waters of a perfectly
conquered sea, this tiny lad may pass into
the harbor of safety and success.</p>

<p>Man was not made for the sea, but the sea
was made for man. Man was created with the
gift of complete dominion over all the world in
which he finds himself. Standing like a discoverer
upon the shores of his own unoared sea
of life, it is his to conquer, for each individual
faces a sea newly created, whose waves have
never been cut by the prow of any boat. No
two people sail the same sea. Each person faces<a href="#Page_184"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;184" id="Page_184"></span></a>
a life as original as it is unknown, but one that
is singularly suited to himself. Age may be
enriched with much dearly bought and valuable
experiences, and be most helpful in counseling
youth, but age can never fully understand the
child, or youth, who stands upon the sun-kissed
sands of the unoared sea of his own individual
life. The beauty and pathos of life is that each
one must solve the problem for himself.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the training and
counseling of youth should be neglected. The
ennobling influences of a godly home with
Christian parents; the steady, guiding hand of
school and college; the inspiration of good books
and imperial thinking, as well as the soul-strengthening
forces of the church, are all of
most vital importance. They should never be
omitted from any life. These are things to which
each child has an unquestioned right. All the
forces for good, of earth and sea and sky, must
be centered upon the ambitious but ofttimes
thoughtless youth, that he may recognize and
faithfully employ the agencies created for his
service and success.</p>

<p>The best that education can do is to help the
individual to help himself. Education is not a
compass by which to steer his craft; it is not the
rudder that determines the course; neither is it
the propelling power that drives it through the<a href="#Page_185"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;185" id="Page_185"></span></a>
waves against an adverse wind. God has made
especial provision for these equipments. The
chart is the inspired Word; the compass, a
divinely guided conscience; the rudder, a will
surrendered fully to the will of God; while the
power that propels lies in the skillful using of
two plain oars that God has placed within his
easy reach. Education is the intellectual training
that enables him to use these agencies in the
most efficient manner.</p>

<p>Many centuries of experience and experiment
have produced no labor-saving machinery for
reaching the harbor of success. If one would
make successful voyage, he must be willing to
grasp the oars with his own hands, bend his
back to heavy strain, employing all his mental,
physical, and spiritual power to the task of
making good. It is not a joy ride or a pleasure
trip. There is a joy unspeakable in the task, but
it comes not from without but from the consciousness
within that one is winning in a moral
strife. This consciousness will be found to be
the chiefest of life’s joys. None shall excel it
this side the welcome we shall receive when
safely anchored in the presence of our God, and
even then this consciousness will be the inspiration
of the heavenly song. Life must be considered
not so much a pleasure as a struggle,
but a worthy struggle, that sends the blood<a href="#Page_186"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;186" id="Page_186"></span></a>
tingling through the veins, and builds the tissues
of a noble character.</p>

<p>After the training in life’s fundamentals the
choosing of the oars is the most important thing.
The craft in which one sails is character, built
to weather any storm on any wind-swept sea.
The haven is God’s homeland of the soul. The
oars are varied, and the success or failure of the
voyage, the safety or shipwreck of character,
a victorious landing or sinking beneath the
waves of obscurity, depend entirely upon the
choosing of these oars by means of which his
life energies are to be directed.</p>

<p>To this end all the educational influences of
home and school and college must be directed.
Youth must be taught the value of an intelligent
choice of the instruments through which his
powers shall flow. He must not be led by fancy
or prejudice or by the words of dishonest men
who have oars to sell. He must not choose by
the color of the paint or beauty of their decorations.
He must not listen to the honeyed words
of an evil one whose sole purpose is his destruction.
Leaving the sands of childhood and
starting voyage upon the unoared sea of life is
a moment in which all earth and heaven are
concerned, and therefore the choice of oar must
not be left to chance or fortune. He must know
that all the proffered oars are not alike, and<a href="#Page_187"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;187" id="Page_187"></span></a>
that false teachers profit from the wreckage of
the boats they set adrift. He must know that a
broken oar means a drifting boat, and that no
drifting boat can ride a storm-tossed sea. All
the difference between heaven and hell is in
that moment of decision when he picks up his
chosen oars and begins to use them as his own.</p>

<p>There are two oars that never fail when once
grasped by a hand that is firm and true. The
first oar is called Virtue. With this oar of moral
excellency, of pure heart and clean hands, with
this oar of real integrity of character and purity
of soul, man’s energies are never wasted as he
makes battle against opposing powers. The real
sinfulness of impurity is its resultant waste of
strength. Behold the wan faces, sunken eyes,
wasted energies, emaciated forms, staggering
steps of weakness, and the uncertainty and indecision
of character, and one sees the consequences
of abusing the laws of purity. But
virtue means more than purity of body, it means
absolute cleanliness of heart and mind and
purpose.</p>

<p>The second oar is Righteousness. Unrighteousness
is the abuse and waste of power. The
New Testament word for sin is “missing the
mark,” energy that is wasted by not being carefully
and accurately directed. To be upright in
life, free from wrong and injustice, to yield to<a href="#Page_188"><span class="pagenum" title="p.&nbsp;188" id="Page_188"></span></a>
everyone his just dues, is to have a means for
directing strength and vital energy that never
fails to bring the desired result.</p>

<p>Two oars—“Virtue,” rightness with God;
“Righteousness,” rightness with man—two oars
that have never been known to break no matter
how much a great soul bends them in his battle
with the waves. Two oars that have never yet
failed to bring the ship to harbor.</p>

<p>This, then, is the opportunity of the church,
not to manufacture oars, but to aid youth and
maiden to choose the ones that God hath made.
They are not new inventions, but as old as God
and rugged as the Hand that made them.
Firmly grasped and resolutely employed, the
harbor is made in safety, although the voyage
be upon a hitherto unoared sea.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
